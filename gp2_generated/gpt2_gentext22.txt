What are the limitations of research on
autobiographical memory? First, there has been
far too much research on autobiographical memory
by focusing on patients who have very
immediate Parkinson’s disease (see Chapter 6).
Second, there are only a limited number of
visual-object-memory disorders, which may
lead us to underestimate the quality of their
memory. For example, many patients with
parathyroidism have essentially intact visual
habits but impaired spatial memory (see Chapter
7). However, some patients with agrammatism
(which involves impaired visual imagery) have
impaired visual imagery, and such patients
may well possess memory problems that
extracts from the visual imagery of those
with intact visual imagery.
Third, the precise information stored in
occipital cortex is important in visual
imagery. It may well depend in part on
the retrieval of information from long-term
memory. However, we need to be careful not
to speculate too deeply about the contents of
that stored information.

VISION AND VISUAL
MEMORY
In this section, we focus mainly on perception
and visual perception, with additional topics
in perceptual organisation and control (ciopancreatics).
There are about ten different ways in which
perceptual or functional information is
held in vision and visual perception. There
are:
(1) Close visual attention; this is controlled processing
within the eye.
(2) Subliminal perception; in which
the individual focuses on the physical and
psychological features of the individual to
specify a goal.
(3) Visual search; in which the ability to
detect a target stimulus is compared
against his/her perceptual estimate.
(4) Visual buffer; in which information from
the visual field is held in relative isolation
(see Chapter 6).
(5) Compacting or blending; in which
two or more cues are combined to produce
a single cue.
(6) Energisation; in which the individual performs

at the goal of utilising his/her limited resources.

KEY TERMS
perceptual segregation: perceptual
assumptions are made at the level of the visual
cortex, with many cues and so-called perceptual

modality-specific information being contained in
the visual information stream.

Evaluation

many problems with traditional memory research are at least as serious as the original
distortions of memory found in everyday life. The
original distortions of memory were very
involuntary, and are often forgotten over a
generation. The discovery that many
different kinds of long-term memory failures also
involve voluntary stimulation of the pups’
boxes by endogenous cues has clarified the issue of whether those
gives to failures of long-term memory are due to involuntary or involuntary
stimuli, and has alerted researchers to the
prosperity of studying long-term memory.
What are the limitations of research
on human long-term memory? First, it is not
easy to study human memory with the same
hand posture and to observe performance
on various memory tasks in the same
hand grip. Second, there are important
differences among human species in some
ways related to our memory capacities.
For example, we are more likely to use salient
changes as memory than other forms of long-term memory, including visual search, in which
the most important salient changes are in the
present and future. Indeed, several neuroimaging
techniques indicate that our attentional
system is heavily involved in the performance of
many kinds of long-term memory. Third,
memory research is at its best when the
challenges of replicating and applying findings
to address several issues are present.

COGNITIVE
NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
Cognitive neuropsychology is all about
cognitive psychology of cognition (see Chapter
2). In this chapter, you will read about
several theories, some of which have been put
forward in the scientific and philosophical
movements over the past 30 years or so. Which
of these theories is the most influential?
Do cognitive neuropsychological theories
provide adequate accounts of our knowledge
of human cognition or are they rather
limited only to cognitively important knowledge?
It is important to establish very clear
points about the nature of the source of information
and of processing. It is also important to
decide whether cognitive neuropsychology
has much in common with cognitive psychology
or cognitive neuroscience.
What are the limitations of cognitive
neuropsychology? First, its applicability to everyday
life is not very clear-cut. What is most
possible with cognitive
====================

The study of brain-damaged patients
has produced several important findings.
First, there is the strongly held view that
the ventral prefrontal cortex is the crucial
brain area.2, 3, 4, 5, this is reflected in
numerous functional neuroimaging studies, including
one on amnesic patients (see later in the
chapter). This finding suggests it is important
to track brain damage in such patients.
However, we need to be careful not to exaggerate the importance of the ventral prefrontal cortex
(e.g., Collette, 1999; Riddoch & Humphreys,
1998; Riddoch & Humphreys, 2003).
Second, there is the issue of whether developing amnesia as a result of damage to the dorsal prefrontal cortex

or the anterior cingulate during the earlier stages
of an amnesia sentence is

accurate. Patel and Ravi (2004)
found that amnesic patients’ ability to
remember ambiguous sentences was
greater when they were in theterior cingulate cortex rather than the posterior
cingulate. However, this finding is less so for
amnesic patients with very limited semantic
knowledge.
Third, the ventral prefrontal cortex may
be of most importance in remembering
to carry out an amnesic episode. Mahavlich
and Lennie (1999) studied patients with
various anxiety disorders who had had episodes
of severe anxiety. The patients were presented
with ambiguous sentences, each with their
actual meaning within the sentence. The task
was to decide whether the ambiguous sentence
represented the “founder of the universe”.
Of most importance, these patients performed
worst when the sentence context was
overly broad.

Evaluation
There is convincing evidence that prefrontal
cortex plays an important role in the episodic
encoding of episodic memory. Various brainimaging techniques have been used to study the neural correlates of
episodic memory, and several neuroimaging studies provide
additional support for our expectations about
the importance of prefrontal cortex in
amnesia.
What are the limitations of research on
episodic memory? First, the tasks and conditions
used to study amnesia generally or mirror
amnesia generally do not permit us to draw any firm
inferences about the precise brain areas
associated with each memory cue. Second
====================
theoretical approach is based on assuming that
there are several different mechanisms by which
information reaches the prefrontal cortex.
One mechanism involves semantic information being processed in the
prefrontal cortex. Another mechanism involves
non-declarative memory (discussed more fully in
detail shortly). Finally, another mechanism
(probably of major importance) is based on the
assumption that readers decide which of two
stimuli to recall. These mechanisms may differ
from each other, and we need to address
these issues.

Declarative memory
Bower and Biss (1981) argued that we
should distinguish between genuine rehearsal
and genuine learning. This is genuine learning
involving the opportunity cost of injury.
It is less impressive to study rehearsal as
a function of whether the two stimuli are
together referred to or referred to solely
by name. If rehearsal involves the former,
we might expect to find patients with
impaired declarative memory but intact
intellectual ability (see Chapter 7). Such a
patients would have intact declarative memory
but impaired non-declarative memory, which
conflicts with the theory.
Lee, Keo, and Svec (1995) studied a
patient with a severely impaired declarative
memory domain (see Glossary). She was
tested using various declarative and non-declarative vocabulary questions (e.g.,
“What is ___?”, “Is it a word?”, and “What
word is ___?”). She was also tested on a
recognition test in which the words “name”,
“image”, and “aphasia” were presented.
The patient’s performance was significantly
worse for the recognised words than the
unrecognised words, suggesting she had
learned them incorrectly.
What causes her impaired declarative
memory? According to Lee et al. (1995),
the direct stimulus effect from which listeners

used declarative memory (the naming of words
in a sentence) dependant on the patient
(s). In their study, the naming of words
in a sentence were determined by the patient’s
ability to generate declarative memory in
the absence of the direct stimulus effect.
What causes declarative and non-
====================

the participants’ decision to adopt a
risky course of action.

Theoretical considerations
We have seen that the optimal strategy for
deterring future losses involves making
successful use of past losses to justify making
future gains. However, there has been
more controversy concerning the optimal
strategy than in all the research discussed
so far. This issue has been addressed in several
ways, most importantly by suggesting that failures
of the optimal strategy depend on two general
weaknesses:
(1) The gambler’s allocation of future
losses does not depend on which strategy
is used.
(2) The gambler’s current profit or loss
is disproportionate to the gambler’s previous
losses.
Hegemonic factors
In the real world, we are often confronted
by scenarios involving future and past
losses. These scenarios include one in
which a gambler’s expected return on a
successful investment is less than or equal to
that of a similar-aged adult (see Chapter
2). The goal is to lose as much as possible
before the expected profit or loss is taken into
account. The relevant information in the

context of the scenario is generally relevant to
the gambler’s decision making.
In other contexts, similar-aged adults
make decisions about their own retirement
money (e.g., IAG; may or may not make
mistakes).
The crucial issue here is whether or
not the effects of anticipated and past
losses are similar. Forward planning is very
useful in such circumstances. However, we
need to be careful about generalising from
forward-planning strategies to future losses.

Gibson problems
Gibson (1975) argued that decision makers
make use of memory to plan and to remember
future action. The ways in which these plans
are organised and structured are discussed
in his theory. There are two key themes that
emergle the issue of Gibson’s approach:
(1) The structure of decision making
making is influenced by past experience and
consequences of an event.
(2) The way in which decisions are
made is influenced by factors such as expectations, knowledge, and future expectations.

Gibson (1975) emphasised the importance of
