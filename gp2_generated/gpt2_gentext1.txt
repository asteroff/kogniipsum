Cognitive neuropsychology
(especially in its cognitive neuroscience) has greatly
enhanced our understanding of human
cognition. However, much of this
research has involved single-unit recordings
(e.g., fMRI; PET; TMS).

Single-unit recordings
In the laboratory, it is often possible to
play back a large amount of information about
the brain and its processes. This is known
as single-unit recording (see Figure 3.2).
In this technique, a neuron in the temporal lobe
responds to a particular stimulus (e.g., a
clicking sound) and a second neuron responds
to a different stimulus (e.g., a tone). When the
stimulus is presented very briefly, the first neuron
reacts to it. When it is presented for a longer
time, the second neuron responds in turn.
The basic idea behind single-unit
recording is that the number of neurons
responding to a given stimulus is measured
and compared against the number of neurons
responding to a different stimulus. The number
of neurons responding to a given stimulus can
be compared with the number of neurons
responding to a different stimulus.
Recording single-unit activity
is very useful in research. However, it is
not very useful in everyday life. For example,
you may wonder why there are two electrodes on
your tongue when you hear someone saying “bend your
fingernails”. The answer is that you have
very limited ability to respond with your tongue.
In the laboratory, it is possible to record
single-unit activity using an electrode placed on
your tongue. This electrode is known as a probe
because it is a probe that can be used to
see what happens when an object is touched.
In the real world, however, it is generally
unwise to rely on such experiments in
terms of their usefulness. For example, in
the laboratory, it is generally not practical to
record single-unit activity using an electrode
on your tongue.

The above findings can be explained by
assuming that the two types of stimulus
are processed very differently. In that
case, the findings would be similar whether
you observed single-unit or double-unit recordings.
However, double-unit recordings are of limited
value because they are only a single-unit
recall. In similar fashion, single-unit recordings
are of limited value because they are only
a single-unit recall.
How do we know what is happening on
the experiment? The most obvious way is to
try to detect the two types of stimulus.
However, this can be very difficult in the
case of single-unit or single-unit recordings.
In spite of its limitations, Parker and Evans
(1999) developed a perceptual priming system
(see Figure 3.3). This involves priming
(involving a very brief delay in the presentation
of a stimulus) and matching (involving
a rapid presentation of the stimulus). Priming
produces a rapid and accurate signal, but
it is not very useful in the real world.
In contrast, matching produces a rapid
but inaccurate signal, but is very useful
in the laboratory.

Evaluation
There is much support for the notion that
perceptual priming depends on perceptual
processing within the stimulus-driven system.
The greatest limitation with much of
this support is that it is mainly anecdotal
evidence. We do not know much about
the underlying mechanisms. For example,
how do priming and matching relate to
