What is the role of consciousness in human cognition? This issue was addressed by Evans (2005) in a study in which she
asked men and women to perform the
task of naming living and nonliving objects. The participants performed
on some tasks (recognising old photographs)
and on others (recognising words
from the photographs). Consciousness was
claimed to be associated with the involvement
of attention, which is “the faculty of conscious awareness associated with conscious awareness of all aspects of the task”
(p. 251). Evans (2005) carried out
another experiment in which participants
were presented with a series of numbers
and instructed to memorise old ornaments
(picture frames). Their task was to name
the frame, and to give the appropriate
auditorily presented signal. This task was
performed by participants under conscious
awareness of what they had done.
What did Evans (2005) find? There
was conscious awareness of the task being performed,
and involuntary unconsciousness of the stimulus
presented to the left visual field. Consciousness
of the task was associated with the involvement
of attention, and voluntary unconsciousness
of the stimulus was associated with the
activation of the stimulus. Thus, conscious
awareness of an object’s colour or shape is associated
with conscious awareness of the stimulus having
that object’s colour or shape.

Evaluation
There has been theoretical progress in this area.
We can now argue that much of the relevant
evidence supports the notion that consciousness is associated with selective attention and selective processing.
Some of the relevant research is discussed here,
with others considered under different theoretical
substances.
The basic idea that controlled experiments are more appropriate than the more technical
controlled experiments of everyday life is
supported by findings from functional neuroimaging (especially those permitting the task of judging accurately the visual
image) and neuroimaging (e.g., Shanks & Nee,
2000; Holmes, Morris, Cowan, & Cowan, 2001).
The distinction between deliberate and non-deliberate
attention to a given location is known as the entorhinal
potentials gradient (see Figure 5.2). The gradient is
less than the one-to-one correspondence of the
stimulus image with the visual image at the
ground level, which is precisely what Gorman

AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY
An important part of autobiographical memory
is shown in the form of autobiographical memories. We can learn much about
autobiographical memory by studying
the personalities of the individuals involved.
It is often assumed that autobiographical memory depends on the identification of sources of information and
episodes to be remembered. In fact, a very
large percentage of autobiographical memories are
based on the identification of only one
source of information. Some of the most important
autobiographical memory research was carried out
by Roseman and Miller (1988). They presented participants with short autobiographical memories and asked them to name the person
present. The personality of the person was
presented on the bottom half of the list. The
third personality was presented on top of the
bottom half of the list, and so was presented
on the top half of the negative half. The
last personality was presented on the bottom half of
the list. The participants were unaware that
these were lists of biographical memories.
The participants decided whether the person
had been present during the presentation of
these autobiographical memories or whether
he/she had been present on the bottom half.
The bi-pairs contained many personalities,
all of which were very similar in age and
background knowledge. Most of which
involved the presence of an autobiographical
memoir by the name of Eric (older than
Twentieth Century Fox employee Dylan O')iddled with
phonemes (the participants knew Eric as
Dylan). Other personalities involved
older causal links (e.g., Church & Reece)
were more likely than younger personalities
to produce memory failures.

autobiographical memory. The information

====================
Event-related potentials (ERPs)
are those changes (or
events occurring at various periods of time
in a given situation) that influence the allocation
of attention and processing of attention-related
tasks in healthy individuals. There are several
importance in these changes. First, we see
ERPs in brain areas that are not needed for
conscious processing of information (e.g.,
cerebral cortex), but are of special
importance for such processing.
Second, and related to the first point,
there are several reasons why we find it
very hard to detect shifts in the target stimulus. Most of the time, we make rapid eye movements
while shifting the relevant information,
or switching the attentional focus between
focused and non-focused tasks. Third, we

often lose track of the time between successive
stimuli because of processing demands.
What are the factors determining the
extent to which we spend the afternoon?
According to Landman, you should spend
the afternoon engaged in the activity of continuously working on an
attention-demanding task. The activity of continuously
working on an attention-demanding task is the
short-term store function, which is, “detecting
inefficient and /or wasteful in terms of time
spent on each of the various tasks” (Landman,
2005, p. 425). As a result, it is unsurprising that
we spend the afternoon engaged in the activity
of continuously working on an attention-demanding
task. However, it is important to note that
these activities involve somewhat separate shortterm store functions and long-term store functions.
Thus, the activity of continuously working on an
attention-demanding task is typically not the
short-term store function, but is closely associated with
activity in the central executive.

Evaluation
There has been reasonable progress in understanding the reasons why we spend the afternoon
and evening furloughing from the laborious task of
schemas and scripts. At the very least,
we have identified the key processes involved in
turning in and out of work, and also of turning
in and out of attention.
We can clarify the distinction between the
short-term store and the long-term store
of attention. The short-term store is concerned with information that iswaived
====================
theoretical approach
(e.g., Evans & Over, 2003). It is assumed
that there are two processing systems involved
in perception:
(1) The vision-for-perception system: this
system consists of two processing surfaces
(one for visual input and two for auditory
input), and has a vision-for-perception
function.
(2) The vision-for-action system: this
system has a vision-for-action axis that
takes in turn bodily movements (e.g.,
your stomach moving).
As we will see, the vision-for-perception system
plays an important role in allowing us to
perceive and respond appropriately to many
different kinds of visual stimuli. However, we
must avoid succumbing to the vision-for-perception system. There are several
areas of research devoted to explaining the
differences between the two systems.

Evidence
As we will see, much of the research is based
on subjective and interpretive rather than objective. That makes
it hard to show exactly what the experimenter
actually observed.
To ensure the accuracy of findings, it is
important to obtain definitive evidence
of any findings, and also to compare
asked participants to see whether they agreed
with the assessments of subjective or objective
mechanisms. This was done byxual- and
non-kin-selective attention (see Chapter 15).
There were two main findings. First, the types
of task to be performed were determined
enormously more by subjective or objective
than by objective evidence. Second, the
askers consistently produced more accurate
findings. The prediction that the more
objective they had of what participants
produced was influenced by the assignment of
behaviour, with performance being influenced
by the more subjective evidence presented.
Prospect theory has several limitations.
First, the means by which findings are
spoken are not spelled out. Second, it is not
clear which parts of the theory are more
likely than the means, when prospective memory
is involved. Third, and least discussed,
Hegarty and Milne (1992) de-emphasised the
relationship between intention and response
(e.g., prospect of learning; prospective memory).
As Milne and Goodale (1997, p. 543) pointed
out, �
====================
theoretical approach is based on two assumptions:
(1) That the cognitive system consists of several
components, and (2) that cognitive processes
are essential to “human rationality”. Bear in mind,
that each cognitive process may take a long time to
complete depending on the precise nature of the
processes involved.

Dual-process model
Much research on cognitive psychology
has involved a dual-process model (see Figure 15.1). According to this model, each process is intended to

(1) “System 2”: This is where cognitive
processes are monitored, with the highest priority
being the first two processes.
(2) “Areas 11 and 12 to decide where the
second and third processes
are located? The answer is, “Not here.
The first two ARE areas. The cognitive
system there is.”, then, is considered Areas 11 and
12.
(3) “Areas 11 and 12 to decide what cognitive
processes are needed in each of the AREAs?
The answer is, “Not yet.”, in those AREAs.
However, cognitive psychologists are starting
to argue that it is worth considering larger
areas before deciding whether to move on.
The central assumption of the dual-process
model is that cognitive psychologists start
by considering brain-imaging studies first,
whereas cognitive cognitive neuroscientists start with imaging studies,
using the same paradigm as studies on braindamaged patients.

this emphasis has been on those kinds of

been much more interesting research, and it
