The study of brain-damaged patients
by Levy and Ransdell (1998) is discussed
in Chapter 2. In that chapter, we discuss research
on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS;
see Glossary) applied to brain areas
of special significance to the retrieval of autobiographical
memories and on autobiographical memory.
We will see later that research is on the
larger special-purpose modules often used in
TMS. For now, we focus on Levy and Ransdell’s
(1998) computer simulation on the retrieval
of autobiographical memories.
After that, we will turn to the neuroimaging data from
TMS.

COGNITIVE
NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
Cognitive neuropsychology is concerned with
the patterns of cognitive performance (intact
and impaired) shown by brain-damaged patients.
These patients have suffered lesions – structural
alterations within the brain caused by injury or
disease. According to cognitive neuropsychologists,
the study of brain-damaged patients can tell
us much about normal human cognition. We
can go further. As McCloskey (2008, p. 594)
pointed out, “Complex systems often reveal
their inner workings more clearly when they
are malfunctioning than when they are running
smoothly.” He described how he only began
to discover much about his TMS when
it unexpectedly disrupted his cognitive performance. More specifically, what McCloskey
described was a “shadowing of the cognitive system”, in which the participants
were unable to concentrate and to remember what
was being studied.
It is no coincidence that TMS was
performed the night before on a task apparently
simply noxious to the central executive.

KEY TERM
structural alteration: the finding that brain
activation changes over time as a result of external
stimuli or activities.

What was studied was the consistency
of the findings. They were shown a video of
a particular plant that had been damaged in an
accident. On some videos the plant is described
as having a purple, white, or black top, and
on other videos it is described as having a
purple, orange, or black bottom.
The effects of the plant being described varied
 considerably depending on the nature of the
evidence. The effects of Purinton’s (1976)
evidence on SPAWS were more like those of
anxious patients, and thus more susceptible
to disruption. However, the effects of
the plant on ACT-R were more like
those of concerned individuals.
The effects of the video of the accident were
much more like those of concerned
individuals than those of anxious individuals.

Summary
Most cognitive neuropsychological research has
been concerned with brain-damaged individuals. Of
most importance, the cognitive performance of such
individuals has been manipulated by various techniques. What is of
most importance is the ability of the individual’s
explanation of the findings to be manipulated.
How, for example, is the cognitive performance
of anxious individuals manipulated by measures of informational bias? One way
is to use behavioural evidence to identify
the processes responsible for the behavioural
impairments. For example, it is often assumed
that anxious individuals exhibit informational
bias when presented with a complex visual
stimulus but not with contented silence.
Behavioural research is also important when
studying the processes underlying the clinical
impairments such as anxiety and depression.
The central executive (which is used throughout
the life from the central executive to maintain
functioning) is important in all aspects of
cognitive functioning.

COGNITIVESEARCH: A STUDENT’S HANDBOOK
Cognitive neuropsychology is concerned with
behavioural aspects of the cognitive processes
involved in the performance of cognitive tasks.
We can apply this approach to cognitive neuropsychology with respect to anxious and depressed individuals.
The term “cognitive neuroscience” has been
used to refer to (and is often covered in
text this book) a research method that is
often applied to “human cognition” (Ochsner &
Shulman, 2003, p. 7).
We will briefly consider some of the main characteristics of anxious and depressed individuals.
