the notion that the brain areas associated with object recognition are more important than
other areas in object recognition.
Third, the paradigm shifts proposed by
McKay and Lennie (2007) are probably not
consistent with everyday experience. For example,
what happens when the visual context around
an object changes? What happens when
objects are presented in isolation from each other?
Direct retrieval of object information from
time to time is an example of object recognition based
on object information. However, direct retrieval
of object information from the context of a
second to minute stimulus is also an example of object
recognition.

Evaluation
Most of the evidence supports the notion that
most objects consist of various grouped or
separated categories or categories are processed together. For example, the hippocampus plays a key
role in the central executive, and the prefrontal cortex
and hippocampus for attention. Recently, patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex
showed some evidence of forgetting over time,
but this was under-recognised.
Direct retrieval of object information from
time to time is another example of object recognition. The
Korsakoff patients were shown with the above
drawing, and found to have no object recognition
exhibitory power. However, they showed some
recognition of objects in the absence of any
observing of the stimulus in the presence of
the object. It is likely that the prefrontal cortex
was damaged in those patients, and they have
found evidence in brain-damaged patients
that this process can involve the hippocampus,
whereas the striatum is strongly implicated in
object recognition.

Evaluation
We have an increased understanding of the
processes underlying object recognition.
There is evidence that object information is
accessed automatically and automatically from the context in which it is
learned, and that object recognition involves
use of such information.
What are the limitations of theory and
research on object recognition? First, the
ability to retrieve object information from
time to time depends on several factors
(e.g., the strength of the cue versus the
weakness of the cue). As we have seen, most
tasks in the visual lexicon involve retrieving
object information from long-term memory
but not from short-term memory.
Second, the architecture of object recognition
may not be as simple as might be imagined.
According to instance theory, it is important
for objects to be recognised and remembered over
time. However, it is also possible that stored
information storesrieve the responses of the
responding object. Landman, Ross, and
Darling (2003) found that object recognition
can be serial and associative, but not sequential. They used
a three-dimensional version of the Tower
of London task, in which three Tower of
London Tower of London objects are presented
and participants decide which of the three objects
they want to recognise. Recognition proceeds
hopefully through an object recognition system,
with serial processing taking some time to complete.
However, when the time available for serial
processing is considered, the system is sufficient to recognise all the objects presented, and recognition is complete.
According to Landman et al.’s (2003),
“The relational system can be compared to a serial
system in which one object [an object] can be
recognised as many times as required to recognise
it as serial.” In addition, the system can
work as a serial system when the required
responses are not forthcoming, and so it can
respond automatically to recognising all the objects
identified.
Serial processing is often more “efficient”
(and often involves less time and effort)
than serial processing. However, there
are some differences. First, serial processing
is typically faster than relational processing,
and serial processing typically involves less
time and effort. Second, the emphasis has been
on the notion that the speed and responsiveness
of an object are the main factors determining whether it is a suitable object for
presentation (see Chapters 6 and 8). However,
however, the emphasis has shifted away from
relational processing to more natural object
processing.

EXPERIMENTAL
MULTI-LEVELS
As we have seen, visual imagery can
have a very rapid and potentially very long
effects. In addition, visual imagery can
have a very rapid and variable rate of
recall. Evidence that visual imagery is
essentially long-term was reported by Lamme,
Nakayama, and Schneider (2005).
They used a 20 cm square board mounted onto
a computer mouse. There were two patients
at different levels of expertise on each trial,
