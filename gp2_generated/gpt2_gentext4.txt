The three-route framework
According to the three-route framework, there are three routes to knowledge:
(1) The declarative route: this is the route taken when
thinking clearly.
(2) The non-declarative route: this
route is used when forming
doctored hypotheses.
(3) The non-declarative route: this route
involves forming mental models to
evaluate conclusions.

Evidence
Suppose we consider evidence from cognitive
psychology. According to the three-route
framework, there should be three routes to
knowledge (e.g., (1) through (2) and (3)
through (1)). However, evidence from
cognitive psychology indicates that there
are only two routes to knowledge (e.g., (2)
and (3)). The conclusion that there is only
one route to knowledge is untenable
unless there is a third route that replaces
the two routes that we have just considered.
The conclusion that there is only
one route to knowledge is a reasonable
one, provided that all the routes are valid.

Evidence
Suppose we consider evidence from brain
damaged patients. According to the three-route
framework, there should be three routes to
knowledge (e.g., (1) through (2) and (3)
through (1)), but this conclusion is untenable
unless all the routes are invalid.

Evaluation
As we have seen, there is plentiful support for
the distinction between declarative or explicit
and non-declarative routes to knowledge.
However, there is increasing evidence that there
are several routes to knowledge that are
more complicated than assumed within the
three-route framework. As a result, we need
more detailed and alternative theoretical accounts
describing each route.

combined in the fMRI study by Smith
(2001).

Knowledge depends on knowledge of the world in
terms of knowledge of the individual members of the
order. Smith (2001) distinguished between
knowledge-based routes (routes 1 and 2) and
knowledge-non-knowledge routes (routes 3 and 4).
Knowledge-based routes are routes that do not
depend on knowledge of the individual members of the
order. Knowledge-based routes are generally
short and non-declarative (e.g., “I have a
Q”). Knowledge-non-knowledge routes are
more flexible and encompass more types
of knowledge (e.g., knowledge of medicine;
knowledge of physics).
Smith and Kosslyn (2001) distinguished between
two types of route between knowledge and non-knowledge:
(1) Knowledge-based routes: these routes involve
limited or no need for formal knowledge;
knowledge is used as the sole resource.

(2) Knowledge-non-knowledge routes: these routes
are used in the real world but do not
depend on formal knowledge; expertise is
not needed for the purpose of obtaining
generalisations (e.g., “knowledge is needed
to make sense of the world”).
According to Smith and Kosslyn’s (2001)
theory, there are three routes from
knowledge to non-knowledge:
(1) Knowledge-based routes: these routes
are used in the real world but do not
depend on formal knowledge; there is
no learning or other process that would
