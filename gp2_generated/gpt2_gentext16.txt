The second problem is that the
theory doesn’t say that automatic processes are
involved in conscious awareness. This is
because we don’t really know how we manage
to “know” about the world or to “believe”
that others are aware. Third, there are
distortions in the theory and in research
on conscious awareness. For example, it is claimed
that automatic processes are used in conscious
awareness, whereas research on unconscious
consciousness has focused on the role of unconscious
processes. Fourth, there are various reasons why
we might be unable to give full conscious
accounts to our intuitive feelings. One reason
might be that such feelings are inconvenient or
distractive to our current goals or to our
emotional lives. Another reason might be that
conscious awareness is unattractive or even
unnecessary for our emotional needs. We
will consider these issues in turn.

Distractors
Why are we bothered to experience
conscious experience? One reason is because it can
be very distracting to be constantly aware
that we are moving our eyes around
the room. More generally, it is annoying
to be constantly aware that we are moving our
eyes around the room. Campbell (1974) put
forward a much more complex account of
conscious experience. He started by distinguishing
between two views he termed sensory
beam theory and perceptual tunneling. We
can, of course, approach the issue of whether
conscious experience is distracting from our
attention-on-the-task with either theory. Alternatively,
we can distinguish between two views
on the role of attention in consciousness. One
of these theories (espoused by So & So)
involves a bottleneck in the processing system
combined with a highly adaptive control process
operating at the principle of nondeterministic
time. The other theory (so-called because
so little is known about its functioning and
because the theory of nondeterministic time
is relevant to it) involves a bottleneck in the
cognitive system coupled with a bottleneck
in the attentional system. There is only one
way of viewing the world, and that is the
accurate way. However, there is no neat, tidy,
dysfunctional distinction between the two
approaches. Indeed, the notion that we are
both using the same processes when engaged
in conscious experience is rather an empirical
one. We can, of course, study the processes
involved in deliberately constructed visual
stimuli, but we must be careful about associating
these studies with the theories of attention
theory and sensory beam theory.
It is often claimed that it would be very
easy to decide whether our conscious experience is
unrelated to our everyday experience. In fact,
however, there is a long tradition of researchers
studying the effects of different attentional
processes on human cognition. Here, we will
consider a few of the main areas of research.
First, there is cognitive neuroscience, whose
focus is on the effects of different attentional
processes on human cognition. Second, there is
appraisal, which involves the appraisal of the
context in which an individual is currently
engaged. Third, there is applied
functional neuroimaging, which involves
the study of brain areas associated with
processing (e.g., attention, perception) rather
than simply looking at brain areas.
What are the main limitations of research
on attention and consciousness? We will
consider that in turn.

VISUALLY
AUDITORY PERCEPTION
From an ecological perspective, the
structure of visual perception is extremely
important. The vision that most of us have
for the environment is constructed to
support various goals, to make sense of our

own experiences, and to help us to understand
the external world around us. In short,
the vision that most of us have for the
environment is shaped like a
scissors whose blades are our own visual
processes and the objects within
them.
Where in the brain is information about
the external world stored? That is a crucial
issue, because what we perceive of the
environment is determined by our
attentional processes. If we cannot access
visual information about objects within the
environment, we cannot help but to make
unfortunate choices about our
visual experiences. Thus, it is very important
to understand the significance of visual
information in our everyday lives.
As we will see in Chapter 2, the notion
that the perception of the external
world is constructed to support our
own goals is very widespread. It is regarded
as a fundamental tenet of psychological
science. In addition, as we will see, it is
often very

the notion of logically organised hierarchies
was too inflexible. They assumed instead that
semantic memory is organised on the basis
of semantic relatedness or semantic distance.
Semantic relatedness can be measured by asking
people to decide how closely related pairs of
words are. Alternatively, people can list as many
members as they can of a particular category.
Those members produced most often are regarded
as most closely related to the category.

7 LONG-TERM MEMORY SYSTEMS 269

Evidence
We will start by considering the cognitive neuropsychological findings relating to the development of language.
Clavel-Paul, Dumoulin, and Gallant (1982) obtained evidence
for semantic memory in the form of
subject-by-object comparisons. For example, they
compared patients with agrammatism (impaired
language abilities) to those with
semantic dementia (free of semantic
memory). Agrammatics had increased
frequencies of word naming and slower
word processing, but the pattern of findings was
similar for both forms of language.
More evidence that semantic memory
is organised on the basis of semantic
relatedness was obtained by Crocker,
Traxler, and Jakob (1997). They presented
pictures (e.g., red roses), and participants
were instructed to click on one of the pictures
(e.g., the red rose). Some of the pictures were
not presented at all, whereas others were
presented very shortly thereafter. The
rhythmic nature of the click pattern indicated
the extent to which the picture had been
presented to participants previously exposed
to it. For example, 94% of the participants
clicked on the red rose when it was presented
0.6 seconds after they had been exposed to
it, whereas only 36% of the controls clicked
on the red rose when it was presented
0.4 seconds after exposure. Thus, the early
stages of word processing were much more
likely to be activated by the presence of an
exposure than by the absence of it.
Evidence that semantic memory is
stored in the semantic network was
reported by Marzi et al. (1997). Participants
decided which of two letter strings formed
a word, and the corresponding letter string
was presented very shortly before the target
word. The key finding was that activation
in the semantic network extended
for both forms of word. Thus, semantic
memory is organised on the basis
of semantic relatedness rather than
relatively early in word processing.
The same finding was reported by
Cobb et al. (2000) in a study on
semantic memory in healthy individuals.
The key finding was that semantic memory
was much better when participants
had previously been exposed to (and
formed a word around) a grapheme–
phoneme relationship strongly resembling
that between letters and sounds.
Marzi et al. (1997) argued that
the above findings reflected a general
approach to semantic memory based on
the assumption that semantic memory is
stored in the semantic network.
Evidence that this general approach to
semantic memory was responsible for
the memory performance of healthy individuals
was reported by Sun (2006) in studies
on word superiority. Participants were presented with word pairs such
as o’ and o’” and decided whether the
second word was the same as the first. The
second word was selected 98.9% of the time
when both words were presented, compared
to only 82.5% when only one word was
presented. Thus, participants seemed to have
inhibited processing for the second word
by which it was associated.
How can we strengthen the argument that
we have a general theoretical approach to
semantic memory? Consider the following
sentence from Sun (2006):
“People spend much time and effort
learning and developing knowledge about
foods, clothes, tools, and houses.” That
sentence provides a good theoretical starting
point for identifying key aspects of semantic
memory. We will shortly discuss relevant
evidence.

Evidence
We will start by considering the literature on
episodic memory. Episodic memory is
discussed throughout this book in connection with
the theories put forward by Cadman, Shanks, and
Alpert (1999

Introduction
Historically, the notion that consciousness is an extremely important phenomenon has been supported by numerous
studies. The notion that consciousness can influence behaviour has attracted considerable interest. The
crucial assumption that consciousness has high priority over other aspects of cognition (e.g., generative processing) is also supported by findings showing high
levels of cross-modal interference.
There is increasing evidence that the processing of complex information spans multiple modalities. This suggests that cognitive neuroscience is
useful in integrating information from different modalities.

•

Constraint-based theories
According to constraint-based theories, cognitive processes are located in a single location and are
uniformly distributed across the brain. This location is called the
constraint-based system. The load on the constraint-based system is low because
the computations within it are relatively simple. According to the dual-route cascaded model, the load on the constraint-based system is higher when
the flow of information is unrolling. This unrolling helps to provide
support for the constraint-based theory.

•

Dual-route cascaded model
According to the dual-route cascaded model, automatic processing of unsupervised information is coupled with substantial
linguistic processing being carried out at the same time. This leads to widespread processing of unattended stimuli. The assumption that automatic
processing is unidirectional (i.e., there is no unsupervised processing of unattended stimuli) is also
supported by findings showing high levels of cross-modal interference. The dual-route cascaded model is based
on the assumption that automatic processes are unidirectional and that the load on the constraint-based system is high when
the information is unsupervised. The dual-route cascaded model is also
consistent with the notion that the constraint-based system is unidirectional.

•

Procedural memory
Procedural memory involves various stages, some of which can be categorised as parallel or parallel split. We use parallel processing when
we repeatedly process some set of stimuli. We split into two thinking
modules when we perform two different tasks at the same time. Parallel processing is of limited capacity, and so requires
conscious awareness to be used in effectively

split-brain patients require extensive procedural learning. As
we will see, there are important differences between
serial and parallel processing.

•

Theories of consciousness
According to global workspace theories, global workspace is used in dual-task
performance. There is a bottleneck in the
binding process at this stage, and so it is necessary to use
executive processes to co-ordinate the functioning of
the global workspace. Evidence from brain-damaged
patients and from functional neuromaging in
healthy individuals supports the notion that dual-task
performance is highly organised. Activation in the
frontal lobes and the anterior cingulate
is consistent with the notion that there is a
world-wide network of processes operating at
the same time. This idea of a dual-task
network is also supported by evidence that
the same processes are used in different brain
areas.
According to the dual-route cascaded model, global
workspace is used to facilitate co-ordination
of task performance. Suppose a patient has
problems with initiating conversation in
the absence of any apparent problemscentring on
the meaning of certain words. According to the
cascade model, this would suggest that he/she has
some problems in binding together task
components.

Evidence

Miyake, Friedman, and Kawano (2000)
studied a patient, KE, who had a stroke.
In spite of this, he managed to acquire new semantic
knowledge of words and concepts from the
media including television and film. He was
also successful in identifying pictures from the
media including television and film. Overall, he was

As predicted by the dual-route cascaded model, his
knowledge of objects and concepts was
much better when he had access to global workspace. He was correct
(100% correct) when he had access to a
textbook full of definitions of words and concepts.
However, he was wrong on the interpretation
of some words and concepts (e.g., “most
popular”). He was also wrong when
concretely asked questions about objects
(e.g., what is a “rocket”? He was
correct with 88% of his queries, better
than chance performance.
The above findings go against the dual-route
cascade model. However, it is theoretically
acceptable
====================
The
central executive is a
rehearsal-based system used in the early stages of learning and in various contexts throughout the day. It is a component of working memory and is generally
less involved in complex problem solving than the
central executive. Evidence that the central executive is of central importance in
problem solving was reported by Asato, Sweeney, and Luna (2006).
Fourteen year olds were given with one eye the
task of detecting letters of a certain type or a
different colour from each other. The task was
difficult in that participants had to process
the combinations of different coloured
letters when deciding which letter to write. The
adolescent girls performed much better on
the assignment of coloured letters when they had
formed the causal decision (60% versus 45%,
respectively).
It has generally been assumed that the
central executive plays a central role in
problem solving. Evidence that it is not
always involved was reported by Asato,
Fugelsang, and Luna (2005). Participants were
presented with an array of three coloured letters,
and decided which of these letters was the correct
colour. The task was to identify the correct
colour for each letter. The key finding was
that performance was much better when the
cues for all the letters were available
(at the end of the experiment) than when
they were not (at the start of the experiment).
Asato et al. concluded that the central executive
has limited capacity, and so must be used
when the task requires some processing beyond
that performed initially.

Evidence
The central executive has often been regarded
as the symbol of speed and accuracy. However,
that is not always the case. Nissen, Lindsey,

278

COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT’S HANDBOOK
for example, found that the central executive
was less useful than predicted by the dualtask
model (Morris et al., 2002). Foyt, Fessenden,
and Douglass (2003) found that participants
performed poorly on two tasks at the same
time (visual and verbal), but could not
perform well on the second task. This is
because participants did not realise that the
second task required the central executive.
Fessenden et al. (2003) found that the
performance of healthy controls on the second
task was determined largely by task similarity
and not by central executive capacity. However,
Fessenden et al. (2003) did find some evidence
of impaired performance on the second task
when the second task involved higher perceptual
levels than the first task. This was
not the case when the second task involved
only visual processing.
Mather, Finkle, and Bülthoff (2008) pointed
out that most neuroimaging research
on attentional processes does not consider the
effects of prefrontal activation on attentional
processing. Therefore, it is premature to speculate on
the effects of prefrontal activation on
attentional processes. However, Finkle et al.
did find that prefrontal activation predicted performance on the second task more
than on the first task.
In sum, prefrontal cortex is involved in
attentional processes of all kinds. The
specific tasks that these processes are used for vary
provide clues as to how they are involved.
However, the notion that they are all of
equal importance has proved controversial.
Finkle (2004) argued that the attentional
system (resembling the working memory system
of the working memory paradigm) is the
system of last resort. There is a double
dissociation between prefrontal activation
and attentional processes (discussed below).

Evidence
If prefrontal cortex is the system of last resort,
then Finkle’s (2004) research on healthy
individuals should reveal the importance of
relevance to attention. That is precisely
what Finkle found. Participants
focused their attention on a red circle
that moved randomly to a left or right
location. There was a positive correlation
between activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex and attentional processes (see Figure 12.12).
This suggests that prefrontal cortex is
important in attentional processes. In contrast,
there was relatively little effect of prefrontal activation on Finkle’s (2004) attentional processes. It is worth noting that
Finkle had hypothesized that prefrontal cortex
would be more involved in attentional
processes when individuals had a high
level of working memory capacity (which is
shown by the use of complex task-relevant knowledge)
or had a low level of working memory
capacity (which is shown by the use of simple task-relevant knowledge). The

syntactic typology of emotions. Adapted
from Johansson (1990).

• It is felt that all members of a
category are represented equally in
this typology. However, some members of a
category possess certain additional characteristics
(e.g., irritable, vain, aggressive). These additional
features may or may not be shared by
all members of the category.
• The same emotion can be produced by
alexia, agrammatism, and fellow travellers
(the “featureless” group).
• The same emotion can be produced by
artificial intelligence, pharmacology,
and/or cognitive neuropsychology.
• However, the emotion produced by artificial

intelligence is “unfamiliar” to most members of
the category.
• The emotion produced by pharmacology is
associated with the hippocampus, whereas
the emotion produced by
an actor playing a musical note is associated
with the neocortex.
The above predictions have been
tested experimentally. We will consider some of
the main ways in which researchers have
tested these predictions.
First, there is the list method. On the face of it,
it seems very simple. For example, if you
can think of one word or phrase in advance
of another, you are set. However, it has proved very
difficult to test this assumption, because
there are numerous possible ways of expressing
the emotion expressed by any given word.
Second, there is the masking procedure.
Participants are first presented with a
verbal report card describing various aspects
of their current situation. After that, they
are presented with a second report card,
which contains a wider applicability
to their current situation. This second report
card is usually more valid than the
first one. It is assumed that the essense
of the verbal report card is more
likely to be believed when it is from the
suppression or suppression expert and
is more easily processed. Thus, top-down
processes are often important in our
emotional processing.
Third, there is the action method. Participants
are told to adopt a particular action (e.g.,
a walking pace) towards a target. They
then have the task of pressing a button
when they reach a certain point. The precise
conditioning conditions used vary
from study to study, but generally involve
the participant carrying out a task at the
same time. The precise actions to be used depend
on the nature of the cue (e.g., visual or auditory)
and the consequent demands on working memory.
The finding that action planning and
action execution are positively correlated
suggests that these two processes are closely
interconnected.
Fourth, there is the masking procedure.
This involves concealing the identity of the
target stimulus (i.e., the reported target)
by presenting a second, identical cue (i.e., the
false target) very soon thereafter. This second cue is typically a cue based on
same stimulus characteristics as the first one. Concealment of the target stimulus often
produces inhibitory interference,
which is why it is sometimes called
cross-modal interference.
Five wonders of the brain
We will conclude this section with a brief
analysis of the brain areas involved in emotion. Before
we do so, however, we need to distinguish between two very
different kinds of emotion. First, there is “anxious”
emotion, which involves high or sudden
anxiety. Second, there is “depression”
which involves low or gradual depression.
As Parkinson (2001, p. 181) pointed out,
“Dysfunctional emotion is one of the most
emotion-impairing disorders.”

Anxiety
Animal models of anxiety provide
a useful framework within which to understand
the nature of anxious and depressive symptoms.
Parkinson (2001) started by asking
visually presented participants to perform
a visual search for a target. The target was
a novel object (e.g., can of Coke, can of Pepsi)
or a person (e.g., famous person). Some of the
participants were then shown a second visual
display, and this time they too held a novel
object. The crucial finding was that the
amount of time spent on the second display
was related to the intensity of the anxious
reaction (see Figure 4.12).
Since visually presented stimuli are immediately
available to the perceptual system, this finding
suggests that the perceptual system has very
centralised control over anxious processes
