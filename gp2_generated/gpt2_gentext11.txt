The second
key finding was that participants with
the highest working memory capacity were
better able to identify target stimuli on
the serial reaction time task than those with
the lowest working memory capacity.
This suggests that attentional processes are important in language comprehension.

Fourth, the findings go against the conventional wisdom that
decision making is typically automatic and
accurate. As we will see, that is not the whole story.
Some deliberate processes are relatively automatic and
often inaccurate while others are fairly automatic
and accurate.

THEORIES OF
LANGUAGE
COMMUNICATION
For hundreds of years, philosophers have
studied the processes involved in understanding
spoken language. The overarching theme is that of
communication of meaning, and the processes underlying
that theme have been the focus of much research
this century.
Theorists agree that the main task in understanding
spoken language is to identify its intended meaning.
According to them, this is typically a fairly simple
and unchanging process involving relatively basic
speech structures and relatively advanced
speech perception. Theorists differ in the
nature of their focus, with some theorists
(e.g., Deutsch & Deutsch, 1963) focusing mainly
on the latter aspects of the comprehension
process. Others (e.g., Deutsch &
Deutsch, 1963) focus mainly on the former
 aspects of the process. We will start
considering theories on the connections between
spoken language and cognition shortly.

Chomskyan approach
Deutsch and Deutsch (1963) argued that
composition of spoken language involves a generation
of meaning from the various stimuli. This is known
as discourse synthesis, and there are three
main stages or processes involved:
(1)

Generating a working hypothesis: this is the
first stage. This is the most involved
stage. It is dominated by the working memory
system (see Chapter 6).
(2) Determining the content of the hypothesis: the
second stage. This stage is dominated by the
working memory system (see Chapter 6).
(3) Retrieving the support for the hypothesis:
the third stage. This stage is dominated by the
working memory system (see Chapter 6).
What exactly is the relationship between
the working memory system (see Chapter 6)
and the subject of the next chapter? It is
assumed that the working memory system has
the ability to generate comprehensible discourse
(coherent and organised information from
the various stimuli). It is assumed that this
ability is necessary for understanding the
spoken language. However, it is also possible
that the working memory system has no
control over the generated discourse and so
can function independently of the
spoken language.

Evidence

Speech perception differs from the perception of
texts in that the meanings of words and
sentences are not stored in memory. The
most obvious explanation for the differences
between perception of spoken and written
language is that the former are more or less
meaningless. However, we need to be careful about
generalising from studies on the effects of
spoken language. For example, Deutsch and
Deutsch (1963) found that the meaning of
spoken and written words depended
on the participants’ comprehension skills. In
contrast, Deutsch and Marshall (1968) found
that the meanings of words were determined
by the comprehension-skills approach.
However, Deutsch and Marshall’s findings do
not show that the meanings of words
were determined solely by the
working memory approach. More direct
evidence was reported by Marshall and Deutsch
(1968). Participants were given the
task of deciding whether a pronoun matches
a noun phrase, and they used their working
memory to try to recall the first word
referred to in the sentence. This working
memory process was disrupted when the
preceding noun phrase was itself preceded by a noun phrase.
Other participants were given the same
task but this time the task was to decide
whether each phrase was preceded by a noun
or a noun phrase. The processing of these two
forms of stimulus differed in that the noun
was pre-specified (e.g., nouns–numbers) or fully
specified (e.g., nouns–words). All participants
used this semantic system to make the judgements
of necessity (i.e., nouns–words).
Deutsch and Deutsch (1963) obtained further
evidence of the involvement of the working
memory system in the comprehension process. They
asked participants to read sentences such as,
“The haystack was important because the
heap was necessary” or “The haystack was
necessary”. All participants were asked
