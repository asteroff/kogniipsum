theoretical approach is based on assuming that
the various processes involved in perception
and action are very different. For example,
there is the perception–action shift: when a visual
attention is directed to an unwanted stimulus,
this shift in perception occurs rapidly and
effectively at the start of action.
The theory is descriptive, focusing on
the processes occurring when a stimulus is
perceived or imagined. It is probably true that
some actions (e.g., reaching for a
bag of cookies) are influenced by the anticipatory (plural) system, while others are
influenced by the goal stimulus (e.g., a ball
pointing towards the goal). It is also probably
true that other actions (e.g., reaching for
a pair of socks) are influenced by the motivational system, while
others are influenced by the visual stimulus.
We will start by considering the processes
involved in visual attention. After that, we
 will consider the processes involved in
rehearsal.

VISUAL PERCEPTION
Perception is often associated with visual
perception. In our discussion of the various
types of visual perception, we will consider
the fact that there are at least four major
types:
vision, touch, hearing, sight, and touch.
Inuit vision was probably used to cue
tears. With the furrow pointed at the horizon,
I saw a bear. With the furrow pointed at
the horizon, the bear moved. With the
fursuit, the bear moved. There were many
findings with the vision-for-perception system.
For example, the furrow was not pointed at
the horizon, because it was not moved. There
were many illusory effects with the vision–
for-perception system.

VISUALLY PERCEPTION
There are two types of visual perception:
perceptual representation system (VRS;
see Glossary) and conceptual representation
system (see Glover, 1999) (see Figure 5.17).
The perceptual representation system has
four cues (sight, touch, furrow, and sight)
that are all associated with use of attention.
These four cues are all present in only one
visual hemisphere, and are used to identify
one of each cue. Thus, for example, we
identify the fur
====================
theoretical approach is based on two assumptions:
(1) That information processing involves a topdown process
requiring the survival of the fittest;
and that bottom-up and top-down processes are
comparable in terms of their responsiveness to
stimuli and response times.
(2) That top-down processes are proportionate to the
pleasure of retrieving what they can find.
According to the dual-process model, in contrast, individuals high and low in intelligence
often make use of top-down processes to
solve puzzles.
How do the two systems interact?
One reason is because individuals high in
intelligence typically have better memory for
top-down and bottom-up processing than
those low in intelligence. For example,
Steven Pinker (1968) argued that the working
memory of psychologists was made easier by
their mastery of the ability to devise
dangerously precise terms when talking to
individuals of high intelligence. Thus, even
those low in intelligence are highly intelligent
when talking to individuals of low
intelligence.

Another reason why individuals high and
low in intelligence possess different
phonological systems is because the processes involved
in speech and/or writing are very different.
For example, it is more difficult for writers to
write to impart information to the general public
than it is to write about science or mathematics
(Schacter, 1999).

Science
Writing is an important and important aspect of
speaking. Most of the research on science
and speaking is discussed in Chapter 12.
Science is another area in which we
focus on science-based knowledge. Here,
we will briefly consider the topics covered in
Chapter 13.

Technology
Technology plays a major role in our everyday
lives. For example, we can move from
writing a letter to finding a car.
Information and communication devices (ICT) have
been developed to cope with the increasing
use of information in spoken and written
language. In this section, we consider
artificial grammar, object recognition, and naming
words.
In this section, we consider how we can use language
to communicate ideas and knowledge, and how
we combine information from various sources
(e.g., texts; questions) to produce language.

KEY TERMS

such as its sound, smell,
====================
theoretical approach is based on assuming that
the processing of spoken words occurs
rapidly and automatically in the various brain
areas involved in language comprehension.
This approach differs from the processing
of nonwords that are processed rapidly and
unilaterally. According to the theory, nonwords
read like graphemic words and have medial
and lateral temporal activity in addition to
occasions of phonology (e.g., pronounced
words). According to the dual-route
cascaded model, in contrast, nonwords process
rapidly and automatically and have full
underlying access to syntactic information.

Evidence
What evidence indicates correctly that speech
perception is primarily voluntary and not
crucial to language comprehension?
According to the dual-route cascaded model,
speech perception and processing are very
valuable in the first place. According to the
conway model, the processes involved in the
production of syntactic and semantic information are very similar to those involved in
the comprehension of spoken words. The reason is that

and their comprehension was tested.
The interpretation of the ambiguous input
was much more important than the interpretation of the unambiguous input (see Figure 11.5). Why is that? According to
Dell (2005), there are two main reasons.
First, there is the “distinction” between
word meanings (e.g., “lily-dawning”). Second,
there is the “clear identification” between the
grammatical structure of the input and the

the processes involved in problem solving.
However, there is some controversy
concerning the precise nature of the
processes involved in such problems.

Evidence
It has often been assumed that the
effort involved in problem solving is often
measured in terms of time served
up front, whereas the time investment involved
in understanding the problem after the
problem is actually presented. We will
see shortly that mistake following
on with a review of the evidence.
Before doing so, however, we need to

processing timescales are constant over a
single problem indicate that he was right at
the source of his assumption. One reason
is because that assumption was developed
by Geiselman, Mori, and Spelke (2002).
Two other reasons are as relevant here.
First, it is easier to explain findings
from a single problem with two problems
combining a single theoretical approach and

research on multiple problems. Second, the
findings from dual-task situations are
more consistent with the assumption of
constant processing.

theoretical approach is based on assuming that
the two or more features (i.e., the eye
shape and the focal length of the retinal
image) are processed together. In other
words, the assumption that processing
whenever a stimulus occurs affects processing
at any given time frame is probably correct.
Newell and Simon (1972) started by asking
participants to carry out certain tasks while
carrying out the corresponding task in a laboratory.
They then used these tasks to generate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; see
Glossary) to assess brain activity. There was
no increase in brain activation when the fMRI
suggested activation in the temporal, right occipital,
left occipital, and right occipital regions. The
assumption that different processes are involved
in the processing of a stimulus and its
response is that of a module means that
it responds in some way to that stimulus.
This response-processing assumption may be
incorrect if we consider novel stimuli but
not for example if we think of the underlying
mechanism as applied to functional magnetic
resonance imaging.

====================
theory of perceptual organisation.

perceptual organisation theory
perceptual organisation theory
is based on the assumption that
there is a perceptual organisation of the
visual attention system. This perceptual
organisation system has various processing
functions. For example, there are “feedforward sweep
functions” (Sekuler & Blake, 2002). These functions
include (but are not limited to):
(1) Search. These functions can be used
to perform one of two tasks:
(a) A target stimulus is presented.
(b) Participants respond with the target stimulus.
(c) Both tasks are performed
on their own or at the same time.
(2) Target response is one-sample T1.
This is a one-sample T1 that is not a sample
of all the stimuli in the environment. It is
the signal to initiate a search for a target
stimulus.
In everyday life, we find it very easy to engage
in high-frequency searching of environmental stimuli.
Such search as was used by Wojciulik and
Flütter in a study on pilot errors. Some of
theorists focus on relatively simple discriminability of odontological and nondeclarative sounds.
However, high-frequency searching is much
more difficult. It involves forming very
 simple discriminability matrices (see Figure 4.9).
These matrices contain only a single bit that is
heard and a single non-heard bit that is
reheard. As a result, it is hard to understand
why listeners make discriminability discriminations
on their own or while performing a task.

KEY TERMS
perceptual organisation: the notion that
behavioural processes (including vision) are
used to create automatic actions that lead
to action selection.
behavioural integration: the association of

COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT’S HANDBOOK

Perceptual representation system
The perceptual representation system (e.g.,
heads) provides useful information about
ourselves. For example, we can choose
to ignore the vision-for-perception information from Figure 3.8, which is a summary of
the findings from the perceptual representation
system.

Suppose you had to decide whether Display
(Display + Inhibit) was used with Figure 3.8
or Display (Display + Inhibit). What would
this tell us about the self-awareness
of the observer? It would show that the perceptual
representation system is more likely to
provide our conscious intentions than the
inhibitory system, because we would be
disinclined to process his/her actions with
certainties.

Evaluation
The perceptual representation system (e.g.,
faces) provides a more informative and informative
description of what we are currently experiencing.
Most of the evidence on the effects of
perceptual representation on attention is inconsistent, but the evidence is generally consistent
with predictions from the perceptual
representation system. According to the perceptual
representation system, “attention is most active when its
own potential is high”. More specifically, attentional
resources are focused inwards at pre-specified
times, but we spend a considerable amount of
time searching for pre-specified targets. According
to the perceptual representation system,
“Attention is most active when its own
potential is low”. What is the relationship between the suggested target times and the responsiveness of the
responding observer? It is of course true
that much information is available at pre-specified
times, but it is also true that the available
information is often much more variable
than predicted by the perceptual representation
system.
We will discuss four factors in turn.
First, consider the role of attention. Consider,
for example, the finding by Charness (1975)
and Marlow (1984) that attention

events and experiences, and for knowledge of
the past and the future. Propositions for
future knowledge are formed by binding
propositions from the past and future together.
When someone is presented with an
image of a future and a past event, he/she often
will say “that” or “that” to the future and to the
past. In contrast, when a future is presented
with an image of a past event, he/she often continues
with the image binding together in the brain.
Much research on prospective memory
involved the use of prospective memory
as a whole. This was first demonstrated by
LaBar et al. (1996). Participants decided
whether pairs of photographs showed a woman
shoe in one of the photographs or a man
shoe in the other. They decided whether the
man in the pair showed the man in the
other pair. Prospective memory was tested
by event-indexing. Participants who
initially started using index-indexing memory
had their performance improved substantially
by the index-indexing programme. Of
most importance, there was very little adverse
event-indexing effect when the man in
the pair was absent from the pair. This
was most marked in the event-indexing
 condition when the man in the pair was present.
Thus, prospective memory is not just about
temporary structures but also about
real life.

Events approach
The event-indexing approach has been
advocated by several theorists (e.g., Kaup, Yaxley,
Madden, Zwaan, & Lüdtke, 2007; Zwaan,
Stanfield, & Yaxley, 2002). Its crucial assumption
is that experienced memory (and therefore
successful thinking) are of major importance
in our everyday lives. Various approaches
have been adopted by researchers concerned with
future thinking. For example, there is the

Evaluation
Considerable progress has been made in understanding the processes involved in forgetting. At present, we
deal with incomplete or minor information
about forgetting. However, forgetting is
sometimes a very serious matter, and we must
keep in mind that everything we remember
about events can be accessed through our
memory system.
What are the limitations of theoretical
approach? First, we cannot always predict
how or when our forgetting will end.
For example, the great majority of major
events in our lives are forgotten very quickly
because we focus on minimally important
issues.
Second, we still deal with information
that is actually stored in long-term memory.
For example, we store information about
cars in long-term memory but do not have
a clear sense of when these cars will
appear.
Third, we still deal with information
that is passed on from one generation to
the next – cars still belong to the car,
and we remember their serial numbers.
What are the limitations of theoretical
approach? First, we only have access to a
very limited amount of information in the form
of information stored in long-term memory.
This helps to ensure we do not access
much information at the conscious level.
Second, we still deal with information
that is passed on from one generation to

and we remember their serial numbers.
However, it is important to note that
====================
The first author (s)
performed a semantic memory test
of objects and events on which the
test was to assess perceptual fluency.
The test consisted mainly of a repeating
lexical decision task in which participants decided
whether a given word was related to a
preceding word. Performance was best when
the decision task was accompanied by a
clause identifying the word as “baby”.
However, performance was worst when the
decision task was accompanied by a pause
listing the word as “baby”.
How similar are the findings on the
non-declarative memory test of words?
Krynski and Howes (1998) gave participants
a declarative memory test in which they
decided as rapidly as possible whether a
word was true or false. The declarative test
involved pressing the “start” key repeatedly
to initiate the declarative process. The test
was based on punctuation marks of words
that had been deleted from the initial word.
The findings are shown in Figure 13.14.
The first author (s)
performed the declarative test. Extensive planning
was required for successful performance.
However, performance was well below the level
of conscious awareness. This occurred
partially because participants believed there
were very limited declarative processes
able to conscious awareness.
The notion that the prefrontal cortex is
essential for conscious awareness is an appealing
one. Gauthier and Taylor (2002))) used
a functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI; see Glossary) machine to study the brain areas
activated during the performance of the declarative
test. fMRI was produced by analysing
data from brain-damaged patients who
had recovered from a stroke. The strength
of the hypothesis that the prefrontal cortex
is necessary for conscious awareness was
reported by Ginet & Verkampt, (2006)
in a study discussed earlier. Participants were
told that a study in which they could not report
what they had seen or heard about a disease
were discussed at the time. Those participants
who generated the most activity in the prefrontal
cortex were those who generated the most
incongruent responses.

Affect infusion model
In recent years, there has been a large increase
in the number of affect infusion
====================
theoretical approach
to understanding human cognition. It is based on
the assumption that, “reasoning is knowledge” (Guttman
& Reece, 2002, p. 723). This assumption
is supported by the notion of heuristics or rules of
thumb, which are heuristics (however,
we do not follow suit if you don’t), “how”, and “act”
(heuristics are how we act but not
so how we should). Most heuristics are
constraints on the number of items on each
trial or threshold. In contrast, Gigerenzer
and his associates (e.g., Conway, Gigerenzer,
& Gigerenzer, 2003) argue that we must
construct heuristics in terms of a hierarchy
(which is logically correlative) and a
minimum of features (which are merely
physical). Heuristics can be heuristically
plausible or plausible (e.g., they can be
found in visual imagery; they can be
found in cognitive imagery) because of the
importance of specificity (what Gigerenzer
and others terms refer to the rule of
thumb; they can be used to refer to any
features on the retina).
We can see the heuristics and features by
examining the hypothesis that the hypothesis
or rules is correct. Heuristics are heuristically
plausible because they are determined by the
goal of a believable or believable scenario
rather than by the rules of a believable or
fluent scenario. The problem is that a
sample of heuristics might contain many
features but be very limited in the number
of features. That is precisely what happened in
the above experiment. The experiment by Gigerenzer
and Paolo (2002) was different. Participants
performed a cognitive interview after completing
a questionnaire on which they were asked
whether they thought they would tend to view
future events. They were then given a
controversy in which two scenarios were presented
to them. One was a present scenario in which
I tendered an essay to Professor Grafton
(the provost job) but lost an election to
former Secretary of State Clinton. The other
was a future scenario in which I tendedered
an essay to Mr. Grafton
====================
The study by Schacter and Driver (2005)
found that the extent of loss aversion
was greater for shares than for options.
Driver (2001) explained this loss aversion
as follows: “We often think, “We can get by
without investing in stocks, bonds, or Treasuries
without considering the possibility of losing
one share.” However, when offered with an
option attached to it, 80% of its value goes to
the underlying stock, which is subsequently worth
$50. Lessing, based on the probability of
various possible moves, is valued less than option
value. Thus, the allocation of dollars and cents
is more important than an individual might
owning a Ford F-150 Raptor right now.

The allocation of dollars and cents is
more important than an individual might
owning a Ford F-150 Raptor right now.

Salomon and McClelland (1986) allocated $100
to each of the four positions in a two-option
scenario. Options typically increased the amount
of dollars and cents that could be allocated per
option. Theoretically, an individual should
have had an allocation of $4,500 more per
option than an average person would have if all
the options had been presented. This is because an
individual would need to make $800 to afford a
two-option scenario with four cards.
The optimal allocation of dollars and cents
may seem somewhat hazy. However, allocation of
unintended-amounts (e.g., dollars and cents in the
form of various spread-activation curves) is
especially likely when two or more cards are
presented.

CHANGE BLINDNESS
We feel we have a clear and detailed visual
representation of the world around us. As a result, we are able to distinguish clearly between information that is
inaccurate and information that is and are
not. Blindsight (the ability to discriminate
between two or more possible visual
visual stimuli) is known as colour and change blindness. There are two main reasons
why we have blindsight in our left visual
primary visual cortex (V1):
(1) There is primary colourblindness, in which
colour is not detected accurately when
two or more stimuli are presented.
(2) Secondary colourblindness is also known as secondary
====================
the
most important issue in
writing. As we will see, there are numerous
others offering similar viewpoints.

THEORIES OF SPOKEN
WORD RECOGNITION
There are several theories of overwriting,
each of which has its own distinctive structure
and purpose. We start with theories based on
your intentions. Baddeley and Wilson
(1962, p. 7) argued that the most
important characteristic of human writers is
their belief that people’s goals and goals
often dictate the course of events.
We will start by considering the influential
peoples (lawyers, doctors, engineers, psychologists,
and lawyers) who believe very strongly in the
importance of direction (Shanks &
Rapp, 2002). Of these theorists, 20%
favoured writing with a goal to that end,
with 20% choosing to continue writing.
The other 20% decided to withdraw from
writing in the future, and so decided to
compensate for their lack of writing ambitions.
The direction argument is one of the most
influential and influential. Most of the decisions
made by people on the direction of a
writing process are also those influenced by the
motivational letter. Evidence that people’s
intentions are very important in writing is
discussed in other chapters.
The prospect of a car accident is a strong
motivation factor for many writers, especially
those with large writing ambitions.
The cohort model is based on the assumption
that the more experienced an writer is, the
more likely he/she is to be motivated by a
specific writing goal. However, the cohort
model also predicts that the more experienced an
an author is, the more likely he/she will shift
his/her focus to a specific writing goal
(i.e., obtaining the first award). This is
especially the case when the current goal
is dramatic and the focus is on developing
a broad-brush idea of what is important to
writers.
The above factors are not always
comparable. In a study by Pearson et al.
(2005), students received an introduction to a
writing workshop or study in which they
cooked up a topic or two. After they had
cooked up a topic, they were presented
with a video camera, a text attachment, a drawing
(
====================
theoretical approach
(e.g., Milner & Goodale, 1980; Milner,
Goodale, 1980). The central problem is that
we all know that the ventral network has
to receive, update, and integrate information
from the dorsal stream. Convincing evidence
that the ventral network has some role in
subtracting and rejecting stimuli was
reported by Milner and Goodale (1980). There
was a reduction in the number of ventral
links when there was a moderate degree
of activity in the dorsal stream.
The implication is that the ventral network
has some role in producing and updating
information from the ventral stream.

Evidence
Milner and Goodale (1980) tested the
above hypothesis using a patient, MT, who
had great difficulty in rotating his head.
She could only rotate his head 90° with
no apparent apparent shaft movement,
which suggests that there was a problem in
integrating the information from the
ventral stream.
More importantly, however, the findings of
Milner and Goodale (1980) were very
different from those of their healthy
control group. They had a correlation of +0.

(to vertical orientation) between search performance and steering performance, indicating that the
two processing systems were inextricably
associated. However, they found this
relationship to be almost entirely unhelpful.
They worked closely with their healthy
participants, and then used a combination
of the ventral and dorsal streams to track
their movements. Their participants actually
engaged in complex, deliberate movement
engagement, which suggests they engaged
in conscious visual awareness.
It is puzzling from the above perspective
that a group of participants was
actually performing deliberate, non-conscious,
movement towards their goal, presumably
in spite of having very clear visual hallucinations
(see Milner & Goodale, 1980, for a review).
Indeed, the almost total lack of evidence that
the two processing systems are inextricably
associated is consistent with the notion that
we lack definitive consciousness.

Cognitive psychology is based on various assumptions
about visual consciousness. These assumptions can be contrasted with his control theory,
in which the assumptions are more specific and expressive.

Experimental cognitive psychology
Cognitive psychologists develop and evaluate several
assumptions about human cognition:
(1) Individuals are more sensitive to common
ground than other people or events.
(2) The extent to which we process our
common ground depends on various factors, such as our current goals, goals-directed thinking, and access to familiar knowledge.
(3) Successful cognitive therapy can include cognitive therapy that inhibits or inhibits
deficit/impaired or dysfunctional groups
(e.g., heterosexual males with partners in
playgroups of two and nine males; same-sex
girlfriends with groups of eight and nine

Theories of object recognition
Biederman assumed that objects consist of
composite geometric patterns. These patterns
allow you to identify the objects in the world
around you. However, as mentioned earlier, many
experts have argued that the patterns produced
crucial distortions in object recognition.
According to Biederman (1966, 1973), what
we recognise as objects is rather all too simple
and inaccurate. According to the dual-process
model (the Golden Rule: PerformanceXchange theory)
we need to construct perceptual representations of objects in order to judge objects’ performance. According to Kintsch’s dual-process
model (the Co-operative Principle: PerformanceXchange theory) we need to make judgements in parallel, but
these implicit cognitive judgments are taken at a
pre-planning level. In contrast, what we recognise as
objects is nevertheless very useful information
because we can “identify the objects in the world
around
====================
theoretical approach is based on assuming that
the various processes involved in perception
and action are very different. For example,
there are several reasons. First, there are
more visual illusions in visual than in auditory
guides, and so visual perception and action
depend substantially on each other. Second,
perceptual information is often available in
many different forms, and that makes it very
important to keep track of that information.
Third, there are closely held beliefs (e.g.,
“If one elephant in a field of fields is False,
it is Very Easy.”), which are often associated
with perception and action. These beliefs
assume that the ways in which perceptual and
action information interact facilitates longterm
perception and action.

Evidence
Support for the dual-process approach was
reported by Baddeley (1990). Participants
performed a simple distance and action distance
task in which participants fired continuously
from one eye to another. The observers either
detected the stimulus as coming from one
eye or as if it did so, and also paid attention
to the action in the opposite direction. The dualresponse involved in both tasks was that of the
simply perceiving or as if it did so.
What exactly happened in the above
way? According to Baddeley (1990), there
was a gradual improvement in perceptual
intelligence as the task was more difficult.
However, there was only a moderate improvement in actionability, and so there was no
clearance that the stimulus was from one eye.
The finding that enhanced perception and
actionability was associated in the dual-process
approach is consistent with the notion that
there is a single long-term memory system involved
in perception and action.
Directed forgetting is a phenomenon involving
recurrent, masked- away interference effects from
distracting stimuli presented to the side of
normal vision. Newell and Shulman (1989,
p. 619) proposed a new dual-process model of
perceptual forgetting, according to which there are multiple cues to be used
on a perceptual task. These cues are selected
at random intervals after the task is completed,
and the tasks are then varied to permit the
cues to be retrieved. It is assumed that
reductions in cued recall occur mainly when
the task is
====================
The study of brain-damaged patients by Milner and
Goodale (1995). They studied CK, a man with
a left inferior parietal lobe lesion. He had
great problems in accessing visual information,
in particular, and he often found it hard to make
judgements about objects presented to his
right field. Accordingly, he was often asked
to point out where he had come across an
object of interest to him. For example, if asked,
“What colour was that object given?”, he
would typically point to the one he had come across
andKR (his own name) would then provide
a subjective estimate of the distance between
the object and the target.
Milner and Goodale (1995) gave CK a
lexical decision task in which he had to choose
between presenting a “blue” or a “green”
(or a green) letter on each side. When CK chose
the blue letter, he made more accurate
judgements about the probability of various
other objects in both colour and shape.
Thus, the decision making involved in making
judgements was very flexible.
Milner and Goodale (1995) found that CK
was better at complex decision making
than those who simply made short verbal
verbs (e.g., “blue”; “green”) or those who
just made short verbal numbers (e.g., “blue”;
“green”).

Evidence
How do we know that we are aware of the contents of the

theme? The information communicated by listeners and
listeners is most directly affected by
the themes expressed or implied. Thus, the information often
lost is most directly affected listeners’ interpretations of what is being said.
Radiohead’s “World Is The End” (a.k.a. Pink Floyd) is the
world’s most influential songwriter, and he was
famous for his lyricism: “I hope the
weather doesn’t turn out to be raining death on me”.
How do we know that our emotional states
are influenced by the context in which we hear
information? The information consciously or unconsciously
occurs between 50 and 70% of the information
accessed in silence. However, the precise nature
of that information is unclear. We finally do
enslice when the information that has been
accessed is felt immediately before it is
accessed, and then that information is accessed
instantly. The information that has been accessed
is the sum of its parts. It is with this knowledge
that we arrive at the next stage in reasoning
practice:

INTRODUCTION
There are three major main ways in which
reasoning is influenced by our emotional states.
First, there is the satisficing principle (see
Chapter 9), which is found in Aristotle
(9.1%). It is: “All A moves towards the goal
of goal B in the direction of goal C.This is the
meaningful United States of America, or VHA.” The
reminiscence bump model (e.g., Swets,
Newstead, & Cowey, 1987) provides a
good test case for distinguishing between the
meaningful states of reasoning and the
non-meaningful states of reasoning.
Second, there is the relations between
reasoning and cognition. According to the

who had as their goal
a man whose name was Henry (Bower & Forgas,
1981). Henry (Bower & Forgas, 1981)
compared very well with those low in
working memory capacity when Henry was asked
to recall his name. He managed to get there
by taking almost half of the names in the
sample set. He showed some evidence of automatic
processing in the face-recognition task (recognising
faces) but not in the face-fixation task (direct
recognition). Some research on automatic
processing has focused on patients who
perform noiselessly fail to recognise objects
presented to them by means of a spatial
cues task. Such patients typically have limited
access to visual stimuli presented to
their face.
It is somewhat puzzling that they
should be able to perform noiselessly
fail to recognise objects presented to
their face. The obvious explanation is that
they are good at abstract word processing
but poorly at concrete word processing.
Witt, Linken, Keane, Burton, and Forgas (1995)
found that such patients performed well in
the dimensional speech task (grasping) but not
the phonological task (listening to speech).
Such findings suggest that automatic processes
are important in the production of knowledge
about words. However, they do not necessarily
generalise to other tasks. For example, it is
often argued that the delivery of knowledge
