Cognitive neuroscience
There is considerable evidence that the prefrontal cortex plays a major
role in the cognitive processing of action and
perception. For example, Volkow and Dehaene (1998)
asked participants to perform an action
followed by a recognition test. There was a
greater increase in activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex when the
participants decided to perform the action
than when they decided not to. This is consistent
with the notion that the prefrontal cortex is involved
in integrating information about action and
perception.

Evaluation
The cognitive neuroscience approach has shown
that there are substantial differences between
processing action and perception. More
specifically, the evidence indicates that the prefrontal
cortex is of special importance in processing
action but not perception. In addition, the evidence
also indicates that perception and action are
processes in different brain areas. The evidence
is generally more supportive of the notion of
separate perceptual systems with the prefrontal cortex
than the one with the striatum.
What are the limitations of the cognitive
neuroscience approach? First, the emphasis has
been on relatively superficial similarities between
the cognitive processes involved in action
and perception. As a result, two systems
(the perceptual and the cognitive system) have
been identified. However, it is not clear
whether these two systems are completely separate.
Second, it has often been assumed that
the processes involved in perception and
action are essentially identical (i.e., there
are similar stimulus inputs). However, the
evidence does not support that assumption.
For example, Inagaki, Inagaki, and Matos (1997)
presented visual displays containing various
stimuli. Some stimuli attracted attention whereas
others did not (control condition). The key
finding was that activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was greater in the
control condition than in the other condition.
Third, it has often been assumed that there
are three types of visual attention:
(1) Static point-light
system: This is focused on the point in
the visual field. It is used for signalling
and for selective attention.
(2) Dynamic point-light
system: This system is involved when we
attend to a given spatial location and
also for signalling. It is involved in
selective attention.
(3) Point-light
system: This system is involved when we
attend to a given point in the visual
field. It is used for signalling and
for selective attention.

KEY TERM
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: This is the
brain area in which most of the executive
processes involved in working out the location
of an object in the visual field are conducted.
