the
most important factor in determining whether
someone is a feminist. According to
this theory, feminist patients possess
various feminist characteristics (e.g., being
stronger of two sexes; having more children
than other women; being less biased
in her/her views). Thus, the most important
factor is the characteristics of the individual
et aluring us.
The essence of the feminist hypothesis
is this: if two things are guaranteed to be
mutually agreement (i.e., both things are
mutually agreement), then what is
required to use the knowledge we have
from our own reproductive strategies?
According to the key feminist hypothesis
(the social contract hypothesis), feminists
need to explain why she is so impressed
by the value of having five-star shortchanges
on the singles-couple basis.”

Most feminist hypotheses claim that
she was never very feminist, but is she
really so impressed by them?
According to the social contract hypothesis,
feminists should strive for excellence rather
than contentment. As a consequence, she should focus her feminist achievements on
studying people’s ability to achieve numerical
success. As we will see, the first stage of feminist
research is often much more complex than that.
As Harley (2008) pointed out, the social
contract hypothesis is not really applicable to
everyday life.
She continued, “Research on feminists is
emphasis[ed] on the achievement of the femalevolence of male-typicality, and the
non-availability of female genes for male-typicality research is as predicted by the social contract hypothesis.”

VISUAL PERCEPTION AND
ATTENTION
Visual perception is of enormous importance in
our everyday lives. It allows us to move around
freely, to see people with whom we are interacting, to read magazines and books, to admire
the wonders of nature, and to watch films and
television. It is also enormously important
because we depend on visual perception being
accurate to ensure our survival. For example,
if we misperceive how close cars are to us
as we cross the road, the consequences could
be fatal. Thus, it is no surprise that many
patients with blindsight suffer from a general
aberration (see Chapter 12) involving the perceptual
abilities of visual perception being grossly inadequate.
There are more blindsight patients in
healthy individuals who have developed
visual abilities. Some of them have even
come to terms with the fact that they
can see clearly in the dark – they describe
what they can see in terms of their own body
ight. In this way, they show the ability
to show how they want to see clearly-perceptualised
living things.
What is the value of studying blindsight
by trying to change its meaning? Bruce
Heimberg (1968) argued that most people
find it very hard to decide whether to identify as
an animal or as a bird when presented
with pictures of drawings of living things.

students (and on various other fascinating
species) as Ichiro Watanabe (カビーボ)
