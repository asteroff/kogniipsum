Cognitive ills
In the last section, we discussed some of the evidence indicating that some
cognitive functions are impaired in patients with
damage to the right frontal lobe. There is increasing
evidence that patients with right frontal damage
may also have impairments of some aspects
of the executive control system. This issue
was discussed at length in a previous paper by
Klauer and Tversky (2006). They reviewed
several studies on patients with damage to
the right frontal lobe. The impairment of
executive functioning in such patients was found
in tasks such as digit span (number of digits
presented at the end of each trial), digit span
(number of digits presented at the start of each
trial), and digit span (maximum number of digits
presented at the end of each trial) (see Figure
2.13). The implication is that patients with
damage to the right frontal lobe have an
impaired executive control system.
The above evidence is rather
weak. As we have seen, there is abundant
evidence that patients with damage to the right
frontal lobe have impairments of some aspects
of executive control. However, the strength of
the evidence varies from study to study.
We will see shortly that the evidence from
brain-damaged patients is weaker than that
from brain-damaged healthy controls. In
addition, there is often some overlap
in the brain areas activated during the performance of various tasks. Thus, patients with
damage to the right frontal lobe often
have damage to several executive processes.
We have seen that patients with damage
to the right frontal lobe often have impairments
of some aspects of executive control. However,
there is increasing evidence that such patients
have only a modest detrimental effect on digitspan,
and that they have no effect on digitspan
when the tasks are relatively simple.
What conclusions can we draw? First,
there is convincing evidence that patients
with right frontal damage often have
impaired executive control of digit span. However,
there is less support for the notion that such
patients have impaired executive control of
many aspects of digit span. A few patients
have severely impaired executive control of digit
span but intact performance on tasks requiring
executive control, and these patients have also
impaired performance on tasks requiring
mainly indirect control (e.g., task similarity).
Second, patients with damage to the right
frontal lobe often have intact performance
on tasks that involve direct control (e.g.,
tasks involving guessing numbers). Thus,
patients with damage to the right frontal lobe
often have intact executive control of digit
span even when performing tasks involving
direct control.
Third, patients with damage to the right frontal
lobe often have impaired executive control
of digit span. However, this is less so
than the evidence

Cognitive ills

The most important cognitive impairment is
failing to learn. This impairment is found
in a wide range of conditions, including
problems with language (e.g., difficulties in
forming sentences). It is generally assumed
that the main causes of this impairment are
failing memory in early childhood. Evidence

rather against that hypothesis was reported by
Jacquemot, Lavie, and Grafton (1997).
The children they studied had normal intelligence
and developing language at an average age of
6–7 years of age. However, their performance
on language tasks (e.g., word identification;

Word identification

Figure 9.8 Jacque Jacque et al. (1997)
performance on language tasks at 14 and
21 years of age.

in early childhood was very poor, being only
average on language questions at the time of
learning. These findings suggest that the children
had a very general problem with language
(as is the case with most early-child
problems), but this impairment was less than
the other two.
Jacquemot et al. (1997) studied two
groups of children, one at age six and the other
at age 11. One group received an early
and an early-adolescent phase of language
development (i.e., acquiring the ability to
select and interpret words). The other
group received an early-adolescent phase of
language development (i.e., acquiring the
ability to select and interpret pictures).
The early-adolescent group had a high
level of intelligence (average IQ of 95), and
the other group had a low level of intelligence
(average IQ of 63). Both groups were
exposed to a mixture of word lists and
pictures. The high-intelligence group selected
more pictures per session than the other
group, and the low-intelligence group selected
more pictures per session than the other
group.
What did Jacque et al. (1997) find? First,
the early-adolescent group had a much higher
level of performance in the selection of pictures
than the other group (see Figure 9.8a). Second,
the early-adolescent group also had a high
level of intelligence (average IQ of 90), and the
other group had a low level of intelligence.
What do the above findings mean?
They indicate that the early-adolescent group had
a general problem in their early language development
(i.e., they could not select the right words
when presented with the right words). However,
Jacque et al. (1997) failed to find any evidence
of such a problem in the other two groups.
The finding that there is a general problem
with the early-adolescent group may be
due more to their greater level of intelligence

Figure 9.9 The
decision–reasoning model of
memory set theory.

There is much support for the notion that
decision-making involves several cognitive
processes, and these processes are more
likely to be involved when the situation is
imprecisely controlled (e.g., with a precise
target decision). For example, Kvavilashvili and
Fisher (2007) found that decision making
in the real world is influenced by cognitive
processes including attentional processes,
consciousness‐based processes, and automaticity.

Evaluation
The decision-making process in everyday life
is influenced by several cognitive processes,
including attentional processes, conscious
awareness of the self, and automaticity. Some
of the strongest support comes from studies
in which the decision-making process is
controlled (e.g., Kvavilashvili & Fisher, 2007) and
by cognitive neuropsychological tests (e.g.,
Wandell, Kvavilashvili, & Fisher, 1999).
The decision-making process in everyday life
is influenced by automaticity rather than
by attentional processes.
