The
central executive is involved in many executive
processes in the real world. For example,
it is involved in attentional control and in
curiosity-provoking activities (e.g., reading
and listening to music).
How does the central executive process influence
our decision-making? Evidence supporting the
notion that executive processes are involved in
deciding what to do was reported by
Baddeley (1972). Participants decided
whether to move a given location. The precise
time at which the decision was made depends
on the nature of the decision and the circumstances in which the decision is made.
For example, if you are standing on a moving
train, the decision-making time is relatively long
(e.g., travelling by car is a long way from
anywhere).

Central executive processes
In the real world, it is often not possible
to make rapid decisions about the best course
of action. For example, consider the
following statements: “Bob has bitten my
fingernail” and “Bob has nicked my sweater”.
Bob has bitten your fingernail, but you
do not want him to bite your sweater.”
Bob may not want to bite your fingernail,
but you do not want him to nicked your sweater.
In the first case, the answer is, “Yes”, whereas
in the second case it is, “No”. The decision
is obviously much more complex than
simply “Yes”. However, most people
do not make the first decision very
rapidly, and so it takes longer to decide
what to do.

Central executive processes
In the real world, decisions are often
made faster than predicted by the central
executive process. For example, in the
second case study discussed earlier, people
did not make rapid decisions about the
best course of action.

====================
The
two main routes
are discussed at length in Chapter 14.
The first route is through the
neuroscience laboratory. This route
involves studying brain functioning in healthy
individuals and in brain-damaged patients.
The second route is through
research in which the experimental
condition is very different from the
normal condition (e.g., from a hospital
within a few kilometres of the laboratory). This
route is more suitable for studying
brain functioning in brain-damaged patients.

Neuroimaging studies
It is often assumed that there are two main
routes to consciousness:
(1) The information-processing route
(see above).
(2) The control route (see Figure 1.1).
What is of most importance is the neuroimaging
study of consciousness. The informationprocessing route involves direct access to
the meaning of the experimental situation via the information-processing route.
The other route (the control route) involves
rehearsing the situation and integrating
it into the meaning of the situation
(see Figure 1.1). It is assumed that the direct
access route is more likely to lead to conscious
experience than the information-processing route.
However, some neuroimaging research
suggests that the direct access route is more
likely than the information-processing route to produce
conscious experience.

Evidence
Owen, Downes, and Robbins (1999)
argued that conscious experience can be
produced by direct access or the control route.
They presented participants with situations
in which they had to respond rapidly
(e.g., “Hello”) or they had to think
quickly (e.g., “Hello”). The situations
were either “perceptual" (i.e., visual
presentation) or “semantic" (i.e., auditory
presentation). The perceptual conditions
were perceptual priming (visual
presentation) or semantic priming (auditory
presentation). There was a second
condition in which the perceptual conditions
were semantic priming (visual
presentation) or non-perceptual priming (non
auditory presentation). The participants
in the perceptual priming condition showed
much more priming for the non-perceptual
priming condition than the perceptual
priming condition, suggesting
====================
Our understanding of the brain has been greatly enhanced by the use of
functional neuroimaging. More than
predictively, this has often meant that
we have increased
our ability to identify and understand
the brain mechanisms underlying behaviour
(e.g., attentional; interpretive) in the
real world.
In this section, we consider several
of the problems that have been raised
concerning the interpretation of brainimaging
evidence. We will start by considering
the following important limitation of the
traditional view that the prefrontal cortex is
specialised for object recognition:
The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
is not known to play a major
role in object recognition.
We have seen that the prefrontal cortex
is involved in various processing activities
(e.g., attentional; interpretive). However,
it is not clear that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
is uniquely associated with object
recognition. The same limitations apply
to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex: it is
not clear that any given brain area is uniquely
associated with any particular object.
The second major limitation is that
it is hard to interpret findings from
functional neuroimaging. Consider
brain-damaged patients having brain damage
in various areas of the brain. What is
the significance of brain damage in
object recognition? Most people seem to
process the visual information in the absence
of any brain damage, whereas brain
damage to the prefrontal cortex often
impairs object recognition. This is
known as adaptation, and the term is used

in cognitive neuroscience (e.g., in the lab) to provide
interpretive support. However, such evidence
is indirect. It is not clear that the prefrontal cortex
is uniquely associated with object recognition
– it could be that other areas are involved.
The third major limitation is that
it is hard to interpret findings from functional
neuroimaging. For example, it is hard to
decide whether the increase in activation in
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during
recognition of a familiar object is due to
increased object recognition or simply
increased processing of the object.
The fourth major limitation is that the

Theories of language
According to the dual-process theory,
language is influenced by the individual’s
willingness to make mistakes. For example,
individuals willing to make many incorrect
words and those unwilling to make many
correct words are both more likely to
use dual processes. However, the effects are
much smaller in many situations (e.g., the
two people reading a book). According to
the dual-process theory, language is influenced
by the individual’s sensitivity to potential
loss. According to the heuristic–analytic theory,
individuals are more sensitive to potential
losses than to potential gains. This makes sense
given that individuals are much more likely
to make mistakes when compared to
healthy individuals. However, the heuristic–
analytic theory does not explain language
performance in everyday life. According
to heuristic–analytic theory, language
performance should be influenced by the individual’s
willingness to make mistakes, whereas
it is not influenced by the sensitivity to potential
loss. According to the dual-process theory,
individuals should be more sensitive to
loss than to gain, whereas the opposite is the
case. The evidence does not support that prediction.

====================
the same
conclusion emerges from a study on
brain-damaged patients. These patients typically
show reasonable verbal and non-verbal
memory for most non-verbal types of
memory, but show little or no
memory for verbal memory (see
Figure 9.13). The patients typically
show reasonable non-verbal memory for
most types of non-verbal memory, but
do not show clear evidence of a verbal
memory. The patients typically
show good verbal memory for most types
of non-verbal memory, but make very
little use of verbal memory.

Evaluation
The three types of memory studied by
Kosslyn and Kosslyn (1999) are
consistent with those proposed by Kosslyn
and Kosslyn (1999). Three types of memory
are studied, and the evidence indicates that
they are all important. The greatest
assumption is that the capacity of the episodic
buffer is less for verbal than non-verbal
memory. This reduces the capacity of the
non-verbal memory system and may well
affect the ability to form non-verbal memories.
Second, the notion that the capacity of the
episodic buffer is less for verbal than for
non-verbal memory is consistent with other
findings (e.g., Kosslyn & Kosslyn, 1999).
Third, the notion that the capacity of the
episodic buffer is less for verbal than for
non-verbal memory is in accord with
the theoretical position of Kosslyn and Kosslyn
(1999).

What is the relationship between the three types
of memory? According to Kosslyn and Kosslyn
(1999, p. 5), “Each of the three forms of
memory is associated with a different
mechanism. The episodic buffer is used for
the integration of information from the
visual and auditory modalities, whereas
the non-verbal system is used for the
integration of information from the non-
visual modalities.”
