Introduction
The central focus of this chapter is on the notion that perception and action are closely intertwined. This notion was expressed by Landman, Spekreijse, and Lamme (1998, p. 50), in a broad brush analogy:
You can see a shark swimming in the bay,
but you cannot see the shark’s teeth.
This assumption is crucial to our understanding of swimming
and our subsequent perception of others. Imagine if you could
only see the shark for the colour of its fins,
but you could not see the shark’s teeth. You would be
confident that the shark was larger, stronger,
and healthier than you could see
with your own two eyes. That is not the case. As
Owen and Beigi (2006, p. 253) pointed
out, there are many ways in which we can measure
the size of another person’s figure. For example,
we can assess the visual identity node (VIN)
associated with a specific face, or the
superior colliculus (CS) associated with
a particular hairstyle. The VIN is
connected to the person’s facial identity
(i.e., who they are) by a series of
integrated features (e.g., name, occupation,
interests). These features can be highly
biased towards perceiving a given identity
more positively than someone else’s. The
assumption that the VIN is biased towards positive findings has been
made by several researchers. For example,
Eyal (1998) found that participants given
a face recognition task performed much better
than those given a non-face task.

Evidence
Eyal and McLaren (2007) carried out a
further study in which participants received
verbal descriptions of complex scenes (e.g.,
a wedding ceremony; a sports stadium) and
imagined observing those scenes. After that, they
were presented with a second visual description,
which was either the original visual description
or a confederate description. The participants
ratied out the conflicting information about
the presence or absence of a given object’s
face. When the presence or absence of a
confederate description was predictable,
participants made reasonable use of their
knowledge of the faces to identify the correct
confederate description. When the presence of
a confederate description was unexpected,
participants struggled mightily to come up with
a coherent description of the confederate
that would be consistent with the observed
figure. Eyal (1997, p. 384) described
this as follows: “A confederate is one
in whose case the information available
is consistent with that of the observer.”
In sum, we should not expect that visual
object knowledge will be accessed automatically
when someone is viewing a scene. Nor should
we expect that conscious visual experience will
be accessed automatically when someone is
thinking about a particular object. These expectations
were expressed by Kosslyn (e.g., 1992) in his
conceptualisation–integration theory. According
to Kosslyn, there are three stages in conceptualising
a visual object:
(1) Identical or closely related parts of the
visual object are presented.
(2) The same object is associated with
some detail or features (e.g., form, colour,
motion).
(3) The same object is associated with
context (e.g., what is the object
about to be viewed?)
According to Kosslyn, the processes involved
in generating conceptual images differ from
those involved in generating perceptual
images. As a result, Kosslyn (2000) claimed,
“We generate conceptual images
not only of the external objects but also of
the internal states of those objects.”
It is worth distinguishing between conceptual
images and perceptual images. According to Kosslyn
and Pylyshyn (1997, p. 241), “The distinction
between conceptual and perceptual images
is between appropriate to the task in hand and
unacceptable to the task manager.” The
assumption that the processes involved in
conceptualising objects differ from those involved
in perceptual image generation is known as
PDE (short for perceptual onset generation).

Evidence
Many attempts have been made to test the
assumption that object recognition is
directly influenced by image-based information.
These attempts have focused on visual
object similarity, comparing the time taken
to identify an object based on similarity
to a target object. However, we must avoid
complicating matters by considering whether similarity
is of immediate importance to the task at hand.
