Bartlett’s theory
Bartlett (1932) put forward his theory of speech production, according to which
speech production involves seven stages:
•

Conceptual preparation: the mental set
in which the writer is preparing the words to be
spoken.
•

Verbal expression: the individual’s goals and
intents for the spoken form.
•

Theory of speech production: a logical
approach to speech production based on the
constraint-based theory of speech production.
•

Speech errors: speech errors that are unintentional and
go unnoticed because of inattentional blindness.
•

Theories of speech production (Part 1): a logical
architecture of speech production resembling the
hackneyed structure of spoken language.

Theories of speech production (Part 2): a logical
architecture of speech production resembling the
hackneyed structure of spoken language.

Theories of speech production (Part 3)
Explicit memory is the notion that memory traces are stored in the semantic system.
Explicit memory is often assumed to be the norm
in everyday life, but it is actually much more
complex than that. Most early research on implicit
memory was based on the assumption that memory
traces are stored in the semantic system. Support
for that assumption was reported by Fischhoff,
Butterfield, and Blanken (1977). They used
fMRI with spoken word recognition to
assess brain activity associated with memory
traces. Brain activity was associated with
only 37% of the word pairs, but was
almost identical for word meanings
or non-word meanings. It was generally
assumed that the semantic system was
important in producing the speech
traces. However, it is now generally accepted
that the semantic system is also involved in
speech perception. It is worth distinguishing
between perceptual impairment (impaired
memory for spoken words) and conceptual
impairment (impaired memory for concept
words).

Cognitive interview: an approach to improving
the memory of eyewitness recall based on the
assumption that memory traces are complex and
difficult to retrieve.
Cognitive interview involves various assumptions
about the processes involved in eyewitness
memory. The main assumptions are as follows:
• The eyewitness reports everything he/she
can remember about a crime.
• The eyewitness reports the details of the
crime but not the motives.
• The eyewitness reports the events from various
perspectives, but this information is incomplete.
• The eyewitness reports the events from various perspectives, but this information is
often incomplete because the eyewitnesses
from different perspectives share very
little in common.
It is assumed that eyewitnesses for whom
memory is a major goal possess various
demands. For example, some will have immediate
rehearsal and/or analysis of the evidence,
whereas others will need to engage in
conceptual processing and so form their
own opinions. It is assumed that the latter
part of the interview will last longer than the
initial part, because it is more engaged.
The length of the interview should be
a function of the credibility of the eyewitness
(an important factor in mistaken identification
cases) and the procedural fairness of the
police (see Chapter 6).
The main problem with the above approach
is that eyewitnesses are often not interviewed at all. This created
an interesting puzzle for Brown and
Vernon (1997), because they assumed that eyewitnesses
studied from the perspective of the prosecution
would always be provided with accurate information.
In fact, however, eyewitnesses are often provided
with incomplete information whether or not
the prosecution obtained the information requested
by the eyewitness. For example, many eyewitnesses
study the case in hand, whereas others
study the case in a journal or a book. The crucial
issue is whether the information from the
journa-

Journals
Brown and Vernon (1997) argued that eyewitnesses
studied from the perspective of the prosecution are
supposed to be able to identify the culprits’
types. However, some eyewitnesses to real-life
crimes do not remember the precise
