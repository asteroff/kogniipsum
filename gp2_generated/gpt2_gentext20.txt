The second
key finding was that the amount of
time spent on each stage of the
interaction depended in part on individual
differences in working memory capacity.
For example, individuals with low working memory
capacity were more likely to engage in costly
attentional processes during initial stages of
interaction than those with high working memory
capacity.
The third key finding was that the
amount of time spent on each stage of
interaction depended in part on individual
differences in motivation. Individuals with
low working memory capacity were
more likely to engage in costly attentional
processes during initial stages of interaction than
those with high working memory capacity.
What are the limitations of research in this
area? First, we must be cautious about generalising findings from monkeys to humans.
Second, the involvement of individual differences
in working memory capacity on the allocation of
attention is not always clear-cut. Finkenauer,
Forster, and Bussey (2008) gave participants
the task of detecting letters. The initial stage of
interaction was spent on planning which
of two letters would be detected, and
the second stage was spent on monitoring
the computer’s response to the detected
letters. The key finding was that performance
was better when the initial stage of interaction
was spent on planning and the second stage
was spent on monitoring. However, the findings
were essentially the same with both
conditions (see Figure 6.18).
The most likely explanation for the above
findings is that participants spent more time
planning during the initial stages of interaction than they
really should have. After that, they engaged
in costly attentional processes, perhaps costing
them time and effort.

Evaluation
Research on human action is complex and
often involves several different kinds of
tasks. The findings from neuroimaging studies
are generally consistent with those from behavioural
studies, and sometimes also neurophysiological
studies. Neuroimaging studies can provide
strong evidence that the brain areas responsible
for our actions are very different from each other.
In contrast, behavioural studies are typically
very ambiguous about the precise nature of the
brain processes involved in our actions. This has
led to considerable interest in studying
behavioural processes in brain-damaged patients.
We have mentioned Damasio’s (2002) theoretical approach
in this section, and he described it as “the
original synthesis of computational cognitive science and
cognitive neuroscience”. As we will see, that synthesis has
been enormously influential.

KEY TERM
brain-damaged patients: these are patients
with damage to the brain, mainly in the
frontal lobes (including the hippocampus and
the amygdala).

6 LEARNING, MEMORY, AND FORGETTING 221
As we saw in Chapter 6, much of the
research on brain-damaged patients we have
reviewed so far has involved functional
neuroimaging. In contrast, research on
other cognitive tasks generally involves
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
which is another way of describing the spatial
temporal resolution of functional magnetic resonance
imaging.
In this section, we consider the main types of
the findings from brain-damaged patients.
However, we must not underestimate the value of
functional neuroimaging in psychology. It is
often very useful to study the effects of brain
damage on previously unstimulated cognitive
tasks, as is done by Bartolomeo et al. (2008).
However, fMRI is not the only way of
studying cognitive processes. Some neuroimaging
research has focused on brain activation associated with the attainment of goals.
Other researchers have used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS; see Glossary)
to produce brief but significant increases in
activation in various brain areas.
Finally, there are the findings from braindamaged patients given
immunosuppression drugs (see Chapter 7).
These patients often show impaired performance
on tasks requiring the use of reasoning or
objective knowledge, and this can be interpreted
in various ways. It can be taken as
evidence that the prefrontal cortex is heavily
involved in problem solving (and so may
be crucial to successful long-term problem solving).
However, some functional neuroimaging research
has focused on brain activation associated with problem solving (especially when these
problems are complex).
TMS can provide fairly detailed information
but is generally not very informative. Rosenberg
et al. (2006) carried out an fMRI study
on brain activation when individuals were
operating in pairs, with one person (the
stimulus judge) always acting as the dominant
person. There were two main findings.
