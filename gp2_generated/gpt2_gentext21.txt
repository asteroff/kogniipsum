the
most important factor in determining whether
someone is a feminist. According to
this theory, feminist theorists focusing on
the role of women in the production of
manuscript planning should focus on the
various components of the feminist theory:
• The production chain; this is the correspondence
between the individual files, the individual
episodes, and the individual
contributions.
• The text itself; this is the structured
text that is printed on the individual
versus on the network.
• The form of the text in the text;
this is the structured text that is printed
on the individual files or on the individual
episodes; this is the structured text
that is printed on the individual episodes.
According to the production chain theory,
writers focusing on the structured text should
focus on the letter-point structure of the
text. The focus of the production system is
on the factors producing the structured letter
point (e.g., word frequency; word speed); the
importance of text factors such as word
frequency in generating structured text.

Evaluation
There is convincing evidence that feminist
and other left-wing theorists are correct
when they argue that we need to change
some of our beliefs to accept a feminist
state. The evidence suggests that we need
also to change some of the assumptions of the
production system. The focus of the feminist
state is on the production of value by the
instructor, with the focus being on the
order of things in the complex world of
production.
Many feminist theorists (e.g., Milner &
Goodale, 2000; Milner & Goodale, 2008) argue
that our beliefs and assumptions about
womanhood should be shaped by the order
in which things are produced and the nature
of the outputs produced (see Chapter 10).
As we will see, most feminist
models of production argue that the relationship
of value to output is very important in
her model. However, there is increasing
evidence that value is very important in
feminist production. As Harley (2008) argued,
 “All feminists . . . share the opinion that the
productivity of the working woman is extremely
limited. . . . In contrast, the female sex apertures
on the fate of the infant differs greatly in
function and function, and is largely ignored by

====================
theoretical approach
to understanding human cognition. It is based on
the assumption that, “reasoning is knowledge” (Madison’s
Writing Spoon, 1982, p. 4). The traditional
approach to understanding human cognition
(based on an emphasis on theories and prototypes) is oversimplified, fails to capture the realities of
conscious cognition, and is often inaccurate.

Evidence
Madison (1932) was pessimistic about the possibility of gaining insight
into the processes underlying human cognition. He claimed that
reasoning can be “scientific, “rational, or “artificial”
“instructions . . . it can be “a game of
rigorous rather than a game of guessing” (Madison
et al., 1982, p. 43). However, he claimed that “reasoning” is
“a complex and intellectually demanding
tactics . . . it can be intellectually satisfying”
(p. 55). According to the traditional viewpoint, reasoning
processes involve some accountability and some responsiveness. The functions
of the reasoning process are limited to those
responsible for producing answers that are
well-specified and easy to understand.” As
Baddeley (1996, p. 4) pointed out, “Many men
have capacity [reasoning] disorders requiring
additional processing, higher cognitive functions,
or special abilities than are required in most
women.” The traditional view is that reasoning
functions mainly in the limited sense of using
human cognition, but reasoning capacity is also important. Some of the relevant research
evidence is discussed in the next section.

Striking findings
Many tasks involve the use of several
processes, and it has been argued that it is
crucial to know precisely what human
cognition is all about each process. We will
see later that a separate section considers
theorems and the systems involved in special
aid and in special education.

Striking findings given increasing complexity
of problem solving, cognitive psychologists have
produced a wide range of impressive theories of
human cognition. Such theories can be
shown to be valid by making use of only
very limited human knowledge, but are nevertheless
informal and often misleading. For example,
the notion of “orderliness to cognition” is often ignored.
====================
The first step in
making sense of the
retrospective memory findings is to
consider the probability of each
characteristic event in more detail. For
example, consider the above
example on participants given a detailed retrospective
memory test. The probability of each
characteristic event occurring during the
test is greater in heterosexual than in same
sex orientation or of the probability of the
test reaction time when participants are given
a detailed retrospective memory test.

(e.g., “Same-sex orientation”; “same-race
reaction time”). Second, the probability of
each event occurring in the real world is
greater than that of the probability of
the participants involved in the test with
same-race partners. Thus, the actual
rates of same-race partner crime are often
much greater than those of same-race
friends or acquaintances. As a result, retrospective
memory is often of great importance in
distinguishing between heterosexual and
same-race partners.

BUFFERING AND MEMORY
INTRODUCTION
If someone asks a question to which
I have just heard, the response typically
is, “Yes”. This is the spillover effect:
You have been exposed to a
complex and unfamiliar language, and
you know nothing about the complexities of
the linguistic situation. In contrast,
you may find a conversation or a study in which
participants answer questions in a given
language aurally somewhat easier than
in the more familiar tongue-flinging.
The term spillover effect refers to the
difficulty in interpreting a participant’s
answers as well as their knowledge of the
variants of language. Here are the main
variables used by participants in everyday
life:
• Primary language: this is the language
they learn at home or secondary school
(e.g., inflections, conjunctions).
• Intermediate language: this is their
common language, and is formed
by special learning or brain training.
• Expert speakers: speakers come from all
major categories, from accountants
to biologists to engineers.

Varieties of language
Many theorists (e.g., Jefferies, Jefferies,
Rees, & Roussey, 2002) have argued that
various

the
central executive, which is
involved in planning, comprehension, and recall. It is also involved in attention, memory, and voluntary
thinking. The central executive should be
associated with all aspects of the working
memory system, including the supplementary
episodic buffer, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, and
the phonological loop. However, there is much
evidence in the literature that the two executive processes are very close in
function (see Chapter 6). For example, Chokron
and Hertwig (1998) studied patients with
brain damage in the frontal and parietal
cerebral cortex. There were patients with
damage to the supplementary episodic buffer,
those with parietal damage in the frontal
and temporal cortex, and those with damage
not so much specialised for episodic retrieval.

Episodic retrieval: episodic and semantic
processing
What is episodic retrieval? According to
EPBS (EbolaDependent Neuropsychology), EPBS is an
adults-only group of healthy individuals with
damage to the semantic memory system.
According to Levelt et al.’s (1999)
(2003) version of the episodic buffer hypothesis,
episodic buffer use should depend mainly
on whether the episodic buffer is in use at a
time or a part of the visual field. Damage to the
episodic buffer disrupts processing of semantic information. It also disrupts retrieval
of previously retrieved information. Damage to the semantic memory system
also disrupts retrieval of schemas relating to
episodic content. Damage to the semantic memory
system can produce semantic interference effects in episodic retrieval and
presence of relevant schemas in the visual field.

KEY TERMS
episodic buffer: a component of the
episodic store that is involved in integrating and storing information from the surrounding episodic buffer.

memory system that is involved in visually guided cognitive processing, and is involved in
integrating and modality-specific information from the visual environment.

COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT’S HANDBOOK

====================
the study of brain-damaged patients
by studying brain-damaged individuals.
The study of brain-damaged and healthy
participants by Danckert and Petersen (1993)
was exceptional in showing that the ability
to predict which brain area would be damaged
depends in part on the nature of the task.
Thought congruity (formed to the task–
unexpected–response model) was important.
However, it was less important for suboptimal
response patterns if the task involved expected patterns. Accordingly, performance was
much better when the task involved expected
or unexpected responses. Finally, the thought congruity model accounted for the lack of
error when the data were obtained from normal controls.

Evaluation
The greatest strength of the dual-task approach
is that it helps to ensure that we make use of
our ability-weeks of practice, which often leads to
additional time available during problem solving.
However, the impact of practice on problem
solving may not be very clear-cut. For example,
framing problems often remain difficult for
over 50% of the possible solutions even
when the problem solver is clearly inadequate.
Thus, the time available for solving may be
greater than expected depending on the theoretical
assumption that the time available for reasoning
is greater than is generally assumed. Finally,
framing problems often remain surprisingly
easy for even experienced researchers, which
raises important ethical and legal issues.

COMPLEX DECISION
MAKING
So far we have focused mainly on decision
making applied to fairly simple problems. In
real life, however, we are often confronted
by important decisions. For example, medical
diseases are often decided by the choice of
do-it-yourself programmes or the solution of
ambiguous problems by experts. In order
to understand medical decision making, we
need to consider patients themselves. Some
patients have very poor medical decision making
even though they are told to expect to be
happy and to be healthy, whereas others
have excellent medical decision making but only
have their medical information withheld from them
for very long periods of time. It is often
hard to know whether an individual is healthy
or ill, and it is important to decide
whether he/she genuinely suffers from medical
decision making. In the two-option

form, but in practice are very slow to change.
According to the theory, individual differences
in learning and memory capacity determine the
number of letters or letters of a series of letters
corresponding. It is assumed that individual
differences in learning capacity determine
the number of letters or letters of a certain length
in this way. Learning can be serial or parallel.
There are two main reasons why individual
differences in learning are not shown on the
basis of proportionate test-retrieval times. First,
there is the “serial” condition, in which
the test is administered at a later stage than
on the serial side. Second, there is the
“baseline” condition, in which a given letter string
is tested for knowledge of that letter. It is
assumed that the serial side of the learning
mechanism is at the level of the baseline condition and
is not susceptible to learning asymmetry.
What is the relationship between parallel
processing and parallel processing? It
would seem to belict between the serial and parallel
processes, because the former typically
processes the larger of the two inputs. However,
the advantage is that serial processes generally
over parallel ones. In contrast, parallel processes typically focus on
the SPRING_PROBLEM and the SPRING_NONTHOLOGY components are
two letters or less apart in frequency.

Evidence
What evidence indicates that some
of the letters in a word are more specific than
suggested by serial processing? This issue was
addressed by Smith and Wheeldon
(2004). They considered the spelling of
adjectives, which is “capital letters” if you

recognition memory
According to feature integration theory,
most everyday tasks involve basic processes
(e.g., finding the letter or word in a
words or parts of words) followed by more
complex processing involving combining or transcending
these basic processes. In fact, however, more

traditional thinking (e.g., structural equation
analysis) is required to understand more
precisely what is happening in everyday
life. Thornton and Gilden (2007)
discussed much evidence suggesting that
traditional processes are important in
reading and spelling, and we will consider
more thoroughly their role in speech production
and speech production in the next three
issues. However, there is increasing evidence
that speech production and comprehension
are more complex processes than was
previewed by Gilden.
What are the limitations of feature
integration theory? First, it is not certain
which components of the theory are especially
important in recognising words. It is
predicted that the identification of individual
words (e.g., their orthography) is influenced
by the characteristics of the nonwords (e.g.,
face recognition; phonological processing)
reading them. In fact, the data do not support
that prediction (Bower, 2002).
Second, we need research to compare
the cognitive processes involved in recognising
nonwords and identifying their orthography.
It is assumed that, in most situations,
words are presented in a degraded form so
that they can be identified rapidly. However,
what is of crucial importance is the type
of degraded speech (e.g., word meaning fragment).
Third, the emphasis has been on the involvement of the lexical route in recognising words, but much more research is needed before
that information is fully available. It is not
clear whether degraded speech is more difficult
to obtain and harder to understand than
replaced speech. It is assumed that the emphasis
will be on the lexical route in text processing.

====================
theoretical approach
to understanding human cognition. It is based on
the assumption that, “reasoning is knowledge
of facts and of what is true, and whereamong
these facts is true” (Ferreira, 2002, p. 178).
The distinction between formal systems
and informal systems is oversimplified. We
can, for example, distinguish between the
form of each system and the ways in which
these systems are organised. The distinction
between formal systems and informal systems
is oversimplified.

Dudanshah (1975) argued that the essence
of the dual-system approach is that, “Each
system is represented as a model or a
system of rules. . . . The question of how to
resolve the problem of whether a problem
is a logical or a moral one is one
that philosophers use to propose the Copernican
or moral philosopher hypotheses. . . . The
two systems as envisaged by Dudansky
and Duchaine (1975) are not systems
of rules but are parasites on the same
cognitive system.”
We will briefly consider some of the
major dual-system theories later in the
chapter. However, it is important to remember
that the major dual-system theories have
numerous deficiencies.
First, it is often difficult to decide which
system is representative or representative only
of human cognition. It is also important
not to assume that all systems are as described by
Dudansky and Duchaine. On that
second thought, it is not very clear how we
can distinguish among the parasites on
the same cognitive system.
Third, the extent to which we have
varied information about the cognitive
system from our cognitive knowledge is hotly
contested (see below). This is important
because it allows us to distinguish among
the pieces of information needed to understand
a problem. It is also important to study
the processes involved in each problem
to ensure that the right answers are
received and the left answers are not received.

the temporal interval permitted. This strategy was
used most often when the target stimulus
“STREAM” was about to be detected, but it was
detected automatically by only one of two processing
options:
(1) Manual Option: This involved deliberately
trying to detect when a target stimulus
was approaching or approaching a
disable.
(2) Manual/Suppression Option: This involved
detecting when a target stimulus was
about to be detected by making use of
the temporal interval between stimulus detection

Support for the notion that there are separate
memory systems for working memory
and central capacity was reported
by Marques, Gil, Gilsan, and Szapiel
(2007). They studied patients with substance
abuse problems who had been given the
task of detecting the onset of a strong negative
panic button. These patients were told they
were going to be tested for cocaine,
ladylike qualities, and no one else was
going to be tested for alcohol. There was
a clear signal for both of these memory
options for “MANUAL”, and the patients
with substance abuse problems preferred
to use either of the two memory
options. This is the crucial difference between

====================
The first author had a very broad approach to autobiographical memory. He emphasised
the importance of strong autobiographical memories,
especially those involving the themes of
loss, purpose, and purpose. For example,
Baddeley and Wilson (1977) discussed the
criminal justice system in great detail. However,
the details remain somewhat unclear. As
Baddeley (1991, p. 4) pointed out, “Many laws
of memory are of little use to the most
intelligent individual searching for information
on his or her former self.” In addition, it is
hard to know whether such individuals are
actually human. The main problem with research
based on eyewitness testimony is that its scope
is very limited. For example, decide for yourself
the feelings of regret and anxiety that each
person in a family feels when a family member
has done or said something to them. Then
you decide which of eight family members is the
same age, gender, or born in the United States
(e.g., father; mother; daughter-in-law).
The first family members you decide are your
mum and dad will be:
• The first child is your daughter.
• The first son is your daughter.
• The second son is your daughter.
• The third son is your daughter.
• The fourth son is your daughter.
• The fifth son is your daughter.
• The sixth son is your daughter.
• The seventh son is your daughter.
• The eighth son is your daughter.
• The ninth son is your daughter.
• The tenth son is your daughter.
• The eleventh son is your daughter.
• The twelfth son is your daughter.
• The thirteenth son is your daughter.
• The thirteenth and twentieth sons are your
agnostars.
You may be wondering why “the” in “the” is the
first family member to be named after a
natural person (e.g., father; mother; son-in-law)
but not the surname itself. According to
Baddeley (1990), this is because “natural” is best
described as “naturalistic” in which the best
words to describe a person are not
the best ones. According to an alternative

the recall of that word.

====================
theoretical approach is that
consciousness is associated with activation
of several intermediate or final
levels within the cortex. Of relevance, unconscious
perception may be associated with conceptual
consciousness (see later in the chapter) and/or activation of the ventral stream.
The four-route framework is based on assuming that
there is much transfer between conscious
perception and the central executive, and that
this is especially so in individuals high
in attentional control. According to the model,
most information processing occurs in the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate,
whereas information processing occurs in the
posterior cingulate and the ventral stream.
The model also predicts accurately those
outlined in other models. Smith and Lazarus (1967), “We
must not exaggerate the difficulties of finding
consistent patterns in the brain.” In similar
fashion, the model is out of date. The notion
that information processing is universal is
incorrect. The model’s emphasis is on the
importance of certain brain areas in specific
problem areas. However, the model is
assumed to account for performance on all
40 task types with no clear exception.

COGNITIVE
NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
Cognitive neuropsychology is concerned with
the patterns of cognitive performance (intact
and impaired) shown by brain-damaged patients.
These patients have suffered lesions – structural
alterations within the brain caused by injury or
disease. According to cognitive neuropsychologists,
the study of brain-damaged patients can tell
us much about normal human cognition. We
can go further. As McCloskey (2001, p. 594)
pointed out, “Complex systems often reveal
their inner workings more clearly when they
are malfunctioning than when they are running
smoothly.” He described how he only began
to discover much about his laser printer when
it started misprinting things.
We can gain insight into the cognitive neuropsychological approach by considering a braindamaged patient (AC) studied by Coltheart,
Inglis, Cupples, Michie, Bates, and Budd (1998).

is processed and reports “oh-oh-oh-oh-oh”
to themselves and to the environment. This is visual
perceptual priming, or visual imagery.

Evidence
If consciousness is priming, then we might as
well eliminate some of the stimulus-driven processing of the stimulus-driven sensory environment
from our learning to code. This is known as
cue-driven learning.
Before discussing the evidence, note
that the above evidence only
considered visual and auditory stimuli. As
we have seen, most healthy individuals
have to learn to produce visual stimuli
in order to understand the words in a
text. It is entirely possible that visual and
auditory stimuli are simply presented together, and this does not
depend on attentional processes.
Evidence that attentional processes can
potentially play an important role in visual
perception was reported by Soon et al.
(2001). They presented pairs of
eye-movement data to healthy participants
and asked them to identify target stimuli.
In one condition, participants were given the
task of viewing a series of eye-movement
images together or of stationary targets. Their task
was to select the best eye-movement image
for each target. There was a strong cue-dependent
memory for the cue-dependent cue (cue-dependent
memory) in which the best target image was
selected.
Soon et al. concluded that attentional processes can facilitate visual
guidance of attention-related stimuli.
What is the relationship between cue-dependent
memory for the cue-dependent cue and visual
knowledge of the target stimuli? It is of
various kinds. Students learn to identify
target stimuli by observing their eye movements. This allows them to use their knowledge of the target stimuli
to guide their attention away from the cue-dependent
memory task and towards the target stimulus.

we consider two-dimensional awareness in the
form of a two-dimensional shape, binocular
disparity, and interference.

Evaluation
We have an increased understanding of the
processes underlying visual consciousness, but
most theories of visual perception have focused
only on perception within the brain. In
addition, it is generally assumed that the
second stage of visual processing is consciousness,
which involves conscious awareness of
the world around us. There is reasonable
support for this assumption. For example,
we often recognise objects presented in
precisely the right order, and it is relatively
easy to change into slightly different shapes as
they are seen moving through the visual field.
In contrast, perception is concerned with
objects presented in relative isolation, and it
is assumed that there are substantial interactions between the spatial organisation of the object and the
processing of information within the brain
from its environment.

that the time taken to respond to a stimulus

– Rotation (dorsal representation) is concerned with considering the relationship between the two parts of the
TABLE. In general, the representation of the
TABLE leads to more errors than is actually
happen.
– Rotation (dorsal representation) is concerned with
considering the relationships between the two parts
of the TABLE. The lead orthographic node is a cell
placed on the urethra (base of operation) or
the thalamus (the thalamus is the primary unit
in the brain). This leads to errors in
copying information from the two orthographic
fields to the display.
– Rotation (dorsal representation) is concerned
with the connections between the two orthographic fields, but more specifically with respect to the
third orthographic node, the connection is made
within the thalamus.
– Rotation (dorsal representation) is concerned with
information about the time to return to the
current body (time delay in degrees).

====================
The study of human
cognition by psychologists Philip Roussey and
James Agee (1990, p. 255). More specifically,
cognitive psychologists have provided
an impressive amount of support for
the above conclusion. However, the key
conditions used in this study were not dissimilar
to those previously found in laboratory studies
on human cognition. Thus, the extent to which
cognitive processes are used in different
different situations varies as a function of
the relevant paradigm.

Overall evaluation
Cognitive psychologists have shown us that
there is a rapid and accurate assessment of
human cognition. They have even shown
we can assess the cognitive value of a
specified goal (e.g., has its value been achieved in various ways?). The Gestaltists
were an exception to this rule. In his
theoretical work on human cognition, Philip Sayers
argued that, “The psychological claims of
everyday people are shaped like the claims of
every other species. . . . Claims of relevance to
everyday life are judged along the lines of,
“Is this human rationality based on or on
unreasonably complex behaviour?” He
started by considering how such claims might
be structured within a single cognitive
system.
There are various limitations with Sayers’
theoretical approach. First, it is rather a
straightforward approach. Only by way of
example will we be able to provide a comprehensive
account of human cognition.
Second, it is assumed that the various cognitive
systems operate in different ways and are
more or less alike. For example, it is
often argued that neuroscientific research
is influenced by psychology and cognitive
research involves psychology, whereas cognitive
research involves cognitive neuroscience.
Third, it is assumed that the cognitive
system consists of various components or
processes, and that it is more or less
possible for a cognitive process to
operate in various situations even though the
components or processes are not necessarily
linked or independent. This approach is
often accompanied by the claim that, “The
cognitive system is like a large collection of
brain components, each with its own consciousness” (Bruce,
W., & Nisbett, 2003, p. 723).
Fourth, it is argued that the notion of
cognitive neuroscience is oversimplified and

====================
theoretical approach is based on assuming that
the three-dimensional space available to
perception is limited, and so is the limited
capacity of visual perception. According
to this approach, spatial or pictorial representations are typically
recalled into visual perception when a visual
presentation available only in two dimensions
pursues closer together than when it does
not move towards that same two-dimentionally
presented area.
It follows that visual perception should be
based on pictorial representations, whereas spatial
and visual perception should be based on visual
representations. Evidence supporting this
approach was reported by Brainerd,
McLeod, the Nobel Prize-winning author, of
a classic book on visual perception (discussed
by Brainerd, Mackintosh, and Brame, 2008),
which was first published in 1956. He
found that his patients could perform
visual tasks reasonably well in two
dimensions of a short period of time. This
is known as cue-dependent adaptation.
In contrast, their ability to perform
visual tasks in depth was very limited (see
Figure 5.6). There was often no cue-dependent
adaptation for both visual tasks, indicating
that visual information was not always
available in depth. Brainerd et al. (1996)
compared visual responses to cues based on

====================
theoretical approach is based on assuming that
the various processes involved in perception
and action are very different. For example,
there is the perception–action theory, according
to which there are three aspects of perception
that depend on attention: colour, motion, and size. There is also the
perceptual–action theory, according to which
there are net effects of attention on action.
These theories are based on the assumption that
perceptual processes are important in perceiving an object, how
to classify objects, and the allocation of attention
are all controlled by perceptual expertise. There
is no direct evidence that attention to the
perceptual cues helps to determine which
answers of visual perception are believable or
irrelevant to interpretation of argument. However,
the net effects of attention on an object
are approximately the same as those of attention
on a printed book when it is viewed with no attention
provided that it is presented to the left
or right of the main window of the main
window of the secondary one. These net effects
are especially great when the object is presented
to the side opposite to the primary object,
and the net effect is typically larger than
usual. Finally, there are effects of attention
on motion that depend on the nature of
the stimulus and the task being performed.
There has been a substantial amount of research
using the dual-task approach to assess perception,
but the precise information stored in memory
is not spelled out in detail. There are,
however, some simple rules of thumb that are
well-established in psychology research. The
initial fixation time on a stimulus (the probe)
is the most important factor. The probe
is usually perceived about 2000 ms before an
object is perceived (Barrett & Reese, 1992).
The net effect is generally about +0.50 for stimuli
that are generally perceived about 2000 ms earlier.
Thus, about 50 ms is enough to produce the
positive impression that perceptual expertise
is involved.Netaji (1999) discussed net effects
puzzles that are either very good or very
good with complex visual tasks. The net effect
is generally a small but significant effect size with
simple tasks involving the detection of a second
word than with complex tasks involving the
preparation of two words. Thus, the net effect is generally only about 0.20 with complex

inability to inhibit dominant response inhibition.
According to the non-lexical decision task, participants indicate the order of
two words in a sentence based on which of
them indicated superiority or disinclination. In
contrast, participants choose one word from
a sentence and inhibit it when the sentence
proceeds in a threatening fashion.
According to the lexical decision task, participants indicate the order of
two words in a sentence. In most
experiments, this is a simple matter of putting the
first syllable (e.g., “The horse raced
to the barn today.”) into a syllable (e.g.,
“The horse ran today). The second
syllable (e.g., “The longhand) was presented,
and the participants indicated whether they
had a hand in obtaining it (possibility or
not).
What did Huntz et al. (2008) find? First,
performance on the lexical decision task was
worse on conditional than on explicit
conditional decision tasks (see Figure 8.10).
Second, performance on the lexical decision
task was worse on visual than on verbal
decision tasks (e.g., “The longhand”). Third,
performance on the lexical decision task was
worse on conditional than on explicit
decision tasks (e.g., “The horse raced to the
 barn today).
How can we explain these findings?
As we have seen, both kinds of task
require processing of the same basic
meaning (e.g., “The horse raced to the barn
on the last day of the week”). In contrast,
implicit decision making typically involves
use of a general meaning rather than of
specific cues (e.g., the weekdays are not
tobacco days; tomorrow’s programme is on
its last day).
