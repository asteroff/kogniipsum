The second
key finding was that the amount of
attentional focus changed little or nothing
about the accuracy of eyewitness memory
for the target location. This finding also
indicates that the focus was on the correct
target location only in the early stages
of the investigation.
The third key finding was that the
amount of attentional focus did not influence
the accuracy of eyewitness memory for
the target location. However, the importance of
attentional focus may be less apparent if
we consider the effects of distraction on
object recognition. Evidence that the effects of
distraction on object recognition are
significant was reported by Kreiman and
Wasendorf (2006). Participants were presented
with a curved path tracing a contour, and
they had to focus their attention on it to

keep track of the relative corners of the
path. The key finding was that the
accuracy of eyewitness memory was unaffected
by the amount of distraction (only the
shape of the contour really mattered), indicating that
the nature of the distraction had little effect on
object recognition. However, there was a strong
(and somewhat surprising) effect of the amount of
distraction on object recognition when the
path was uncrossed. This suggests that the
shape of the contour had a major impact
on object recognition even when the entire
course was attended to vigorously.
Mather, Poon, and Varma (2008) carried
out a meta-analysis of over 100 laboratory
studies on eyewitness memory. Of the
studies that reported changes in eyewitness
memory over time, the majority (97) reported
that the nature of the change (e.g., a change in
the perspective of the eyewitness) was very
important in determining memory performance.
In contrast, only 4% of the studies reported
changes in memory for other types of event (e.g.,
physical changes; social changes). Thus, the
nature of the change (changing perspective) was very
important in determining memory for other
types of event.
In sum, our understanding of eyewitness
memory is expanding rapidly. The increasing
importance of physical evidence (e.g., blood
spots) in the investigation of crime is consistent
with the assumption that physical features are
very important in eyewitness memory. However,
it has proved hard to predict when such evidence
will be of most value.

Witness or suspect?
We often focus on the word “eyewitness” when
referring to the memory traces left behind
on the scene by the culprit or suspects. However,
what we really mean when we refer to
eyewitnesses is “by whom eyewitnesses were
confronted by events, tasks, or objects” (Scoville &
Scoville, 1956, p. 241). This is because
it is the person(s) responsible for a crime
(whether by a bystander or a detective) who
has the ability to identify the culprit(s) and
to provide a motive for the crime. Scoville and
Scoville (1950) explained that eyewitnesses
are confronted by three types of object in
the course of a typical day:
• Statues: these are objects that stand
for individuals or things and which
we like to think of as objects of

interest to us. For example, we like to think of
statues as objects of great importance to
our everyday lives.
• Furniture: this is most often a visual
object, and is of particular importance to
our everyday lives. It includes tools,
burglars, and cats.
• Vehicles: these are objects that have
been specially designed for use by a
specified manufacturer or designer. They can
be bicycles, cars, boats, or cars
towed in a field.
According to the theory, eyewitnesses
figure out fairly rapidly which objects are
important to them by using various rules
of thumb. For example, someone may notice
a shopworn pair of shoes lying on the
walk, and immediately associate them
with the person seen in the CCTV footage.
Other eyewitnesses to crimes may notice in passing
a relative lack of detail the distinctive colour of
the perpetrator’s shoes, and so be willing to overlook
the shopworn pair of shoes.
In sum, we use various sources of information
at the same time when identifying people’s
names. This practice involves the tripartite
assumption that we are able to use three
levels of information at the same time:
• The perceptual level: the sensory information
about the visual environment provided
by the visual cues we use.
• The conceptual level: the implications
of that knowledge for our understanding
of
