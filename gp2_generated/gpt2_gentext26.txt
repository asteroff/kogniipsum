The study by Smith and Kirby (2001)
was limited in that the tasks used were
well-defined, involved simple operators such
as “if(suffix)”, and did not require any
knowledge of the language system. In
addition, the language tasks used in both
patients were designed to be simple.
At the most basic level, however, there
is the “knowledge-lean” model. According
to this model, it is possible to acquire “relatively
unlimited” knowledge through practice,
which involves little or no effort to produce
scenarios or to provide examples of what
we know about something. It is also possible
that the knowledge possessed by learners
plays some part in the early processes of learning.
LANGUAGE

A study by Smith and Kirby (2001)
found that there was a small but significant
leads to widespread activation of language in language
processes including those involved in the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketchpad. Language was further developed through practice and
IQ testing. Overall, the genetic basis
of language was not discovered, but some
similar genes were identified in brain-damaged
patients.

Evaluation
The model has proved very successful. It is
predicted that most errors and biases in human
thinking will be eliminated by the model, and
humans become more rational and efficient.
However, cognitive biases are not eliminated until
much later in the model. The evidence
supports the prediction. ACT-R has little to say about the structure of human cognitive
processing other than that it is very informative.
There are several limitations with the model.
First, the assumption that humans always
make as much use of external information than
we need to because much of the information actually used is provided by others. Second,
humanly efficient and efficient strategies for processing conflict-resolution information have
often been found. Problems with that were
found in studies on the serial reaction time task
found that individuals low in self-esteem and those high in intelligence failed to use that task
when instructed to resort to informal reasoning. Third, the assumption that only some external stimulus is used is too inflexible with large numbers of stimuli.
====================
The brain
areas associated with conscious perception
are activated during conscious perception
of perceptual information. However, the precise
brain areas involved in conscious perception
are not clearly defined. It has been argued
that the prefrontal cortex is specialised for
different functions – it would be useful to
identify such areas. For example, there is
evidence that patients with damage to
the prefrontal cortex seem to exhibit great difficulty
in recognising visual stimuli presented to their
own visual field (Kosslyn & Baddeley, 2007).
It is likely that the prefrontal cortex is
specialised for specific functions, and so such
deficient performance on tasks involving those
two kinds of functions would probably be
characterised by patients with damage to
the prefrontal cortex.

KEY TERMS
conscious perception: processing that occurs
below the level of conscious awareness.
prefrontal cortex: one of the brain areas damaged in
this skill, whereby the capacity to recognise
familiar faces decreases below conscious awareness.
insight: the experience of suddenly realising
how to solve a problem.

that a solution is needed.

Evidence
Evidence that prefrontal cortex damage can
lead to task performance under some conditions
was reported by Kozna and co-authors. They
studied a 23-year-old woman who was very
poor at solving problem after problem. She was
tested by solving problems under both linear
and four-dimensional scenes, and found
it took nearly 50% of her processing
time to solve each problem. When the same
similar problems were presented to different
demands, more prefrontal damage was associated
with more task performance.
The prefrontal area is known to be involved
in executive processing, and it has also been
studied on children with developmental
prosopagnosia. There was prefrontal damage
when the parents had to-go decisions made
in anger. There was no evidence when those
goals made no sense when they were accompanied
by severe anxiety. Thus, the prefrontal
area may play an important role in dealing with
anxiety.
Kosslyn et al. (2007) argued that the
development of an anxiety disorder involves
developmental problems with the ability
to perceive emotional stimuli. Through the
sonic-span hypothesis, it is assumed that

of the

eyewitnesses’ description of the
event. Participants were initially given
an autograph by Jack Nicholson (the father
of the famous actor and current president of
the United States). Jack was present, but
he said nothing. After that, the eyewitnesses
provided a description of the car that had
on the road. After that, they provided a
test of recognition memory.
What did the eyewitnesses tell the
eyewitnesses? Most (but not all) reported
that they had seen the man in the road
before. About 50% of the eyewitnesses said
they had not seen the car before, and the
main cause of their forgetting was that they
did not know the car was in the area before
the accident.
In sum, poor memory is associated with
several different kinds of event. However,
what is most striking is that memory
is all over the place in an instant, in
a room before a road, and so some of the
information about the accident before
you is still outstanding.

EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY
Many people remember some of the most
distressing and heart-wrenching details of
crimes involving self-injury in the home
and the workplace. However, we also know
a great deal about the worst and only
phenomenal aspects of most everyday life.
In this section, we focus on the two main
issues relating to eyewitness memory:
what is true of our past and our
future: what is true of our
past and what is false of our future.
The origins of the two major issues
discussed in this section can be seen in Oaksford’s
contention of Bartlett (1968). One of the key
issues was whether eyewitness testimony was
accurate when taken at the time of a crime.
The answer is a resounding “Yes” to all three
asked. In addition, there is plentiful evidence
that eyewitnesses and eyewitness storytellers often
neglect the information in the memory system
and embellish the details to fit their
previous story. Thus, it is no surprise that eyewitness
memory is often deficient when the crime is
very old and very diverse and very difficult
to explain to those unfamiliar with the past.
The second major issue that many people
dismantled was the
====================
the first sentence.
The second sentence is relevant to
our current situation or learning, and
the third sentence is relevant to a future
one. Thus, the current situation or learning
may influence the second sentence, but it is
not sufficient to do so with the first sentence.
The prediction is that readers and listeners will
always vary the informational overlap
provided by the two sentences, because they
will use the information provided by the first
sentence to conform to the informational
overlap.
What is of interest is to see whether the
various informational overlaps between the
current and future sentences (e.g., the
first sentence) are less ambiguous. It is more
difficult to understand the second sentence
when the first sentence is more ambiguous
than the second. The key finding is that the
various interpretations of ambiguous sentences
are more varied than the one obtained
under normal conditions. This suggests that
the processing of ambiguous sentences involves
more holistic, parallel, or parallel search
 processes than assumed within the model.
How similar are the processes assumed within
WEAVER++ to those assumed within
ROSE: BASIC PROCESSES model?
Kaufer et al. (1999) argued that
WEAVER++ consists of two major
levels: (1) System 1; and (2)
Multi-level “processors” that can be
combined operant conditioning and
conditioning. There are also dual level
conduits, with each level producing
specific outputs depending on the conditions
under consideration.
The first stage involves imitation,
in which a given learned strategy is used
to achieve desired results. Examples of
example are the recall task (from which participants learn to memorise a letter
string) and the naming task (from which
participants learn to name the string).
The second stage is learning, in which
different representations of the same letter or
string are formed. This is a type of
mirror learning, and is also known as serial
learning. In most connectionist models, the
constructive process (based on the assignment
of a goal to some representation) and the
sequent constructive process (based on learning and use of the goal) are the two
levels of learning.
In contrast, in WEAVER++, each level
of representation (e.g., the representation

Theoretical approaches
to emotion regulation have various
strengths and limitations. First, it is clearly an
interesting approach to explaining some of the
phenomena associated with and associated with
emotion. The two most important theoretical
assumptions are as follows:
(1) There is a rapid, automatic process
inhibition or cue-driven processing that selects
the appropriate stimulus for each cue.
(2) There is more capacity in early
visual cortex than in posterior visual cortex
to plan and control emotional experience.
Third, the two visual stimuli that are presented to
each eye are paired stimulus to stimulus (i.e., two
stimuli being presented at the same time; see Figure 4.5).
As predicted, early visual cortex is more
active during planning than during control
activity, and this is reflected in increased activity
in early visual cortex. However, control is
bilateral and stimulus planning is relatively
slow compared to planning, and so does not
involve conscious awareness.
Kintsch and Wann (1982) found that many
brain-damaged patients had comparable
brain functioning to that of healthy
individuals. In addition, healthy individuals
produced as much information as did
impaired healthy controls on emotion
tasks but the two groups did not.
It is likely that the two groups did
not engage in conscious awareness of the
information present in the two stimuli,
and the only thing that survived to write
an emotional signal was themselves.

Evaluation
There are various reasons for accepting
the involvement of early visual cortex
in emotion. First, it is obvious that their
processing system is considerably more
advanced than that of healthy individuals.
Second, it has been established that early
visual cortex is of major importance in visual
perception. It is also established that the
perception of objects is more vivid and
accurate than that of stimuli to be
perceived. Third, it is established that
visual imagery can be rich in information
about the environment and also important
for understanding the subsequent experience
of an object. Fourth, it is established that
perception of an object can be rich and accurate
indeed than imagery of objects can be
deeply experiential.
