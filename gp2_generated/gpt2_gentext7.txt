the two words in the sentence, “The saw and
the cat are good friends”, are both highly
valuable. However, the fact that the sentence
requires the speaker to make use of the
words “saw” and “cat” is not.

The above example illustrates a general
problem with speaker–listener
relationship. Suppose the speaker says
to the listener, “Look, here is your
salad”, and the listener asks, “What
salad?” The first thing the speaker has to
say is, “What salad?” However, the second
word in the sentence, “What salad?”, is
very highly valued by the listener. The
listener may initially think the salad is
very trivial, but may become convinced
that the salad is important.

Evaluation
There is much support for the speaker–listener
model. Listeners expect that speakers and
listeners will make use of the two words they
ask for, and they are disappointed if the
listeners do not. The model explains
many of the typical findings in which
listeners interpret what the speakers say,
and listeners become desensitized
to the use of the two words they do not
ask for.
What are the limitations of the speaker–
listener model? First, it is not entirely correct
to regard the two words the listener
asks for as irrelevant. For example,
if the listener “paused” while the speaker
said, “Look, here is your salad”, then
you would not know that the speaker had
resorted to “salad”. You would know
that the speaker had used the two words he
asked for, but would not know that the
listener had used them.
Second, the model is not designed
to predict what listeners will think of
other people. For example, Glucksberg
and Tversky (e.g., 1995) assumed that
listeners’ evaluations of speakers depend
on their personal attributes (e.g., their
personal personalities; their level of
success in speaking). However, Glucksberg
and Tversky were mistaken in assuming that
listeners only evaluate speakers’s personalities
on the basis
====================
on the right-hemisphere
system. The existence of this effect suggests
that the right hemisphere plays an important
role in guiding behaviour.

Evaluation
There is convincing evidence for the
dual-task paradigm in several
different ways. First, there is clear evidence
for the existence of the right-hemisphere
anomaly. This is consistent with the notion
that the right-hemisphere system is
used for goal-directed attentional
control and the right hemisphere for stimulus
selective attention.
Second, the findings are more consistent with
dual-task than dual-process theories. As
we have seen, there is some evidence for
the existence of the right-hemisphere
anomaly. However, it is less clear that the
right-hemisphere system is completely
separated from the left hemisphere. It is
likely that there are important interrelationships
among the various components of the
right-hemisphere system.
Third, the findings on dual-task
performance are more consistent with
dual-process theory than with single-process
one. As we have seen, there is plentiful
evidence that the right-hemisphere system
is of major importance in goal-directed
attentional control. However, it is less clear
that the right-hemisphere system is completely
separated from the left hemisphere. It is
likely that there are important interrelationships
among the various components of the right
hemisphere system.

Single-process theory
Einstein and McDaniel (2005) put forward
a single-process theory, according
to which attentional processes are controlled
by the right hemisphere and by the left
hemisphere (see Figure 3.10). According to
this theory, there are three attentional
processes:
(1) Automaticity: This involves automaticity,
in which attentional processes are
fast and automatic.
(2) Selectivity: This involves selective
attention, in which attentional processes
are responsive to only a few selected stimuli.
(3) Determination: This involves deliberate
attention, in which attentional processes
decide what stimuli to pay particular
attention to.
According to the theory of Einstein and McDaniel
(2005), attentional processes are controlled
by the right hemisphere and by the left
hemisphere. However, the right-
====================
and
Levin (2007) argued that the
two kinds of task share certain similarities.
They agreed that the main differences
are in the timing of the two tasks. However,
they disagreed as to whether the two tasks
involve different processes. Levin and
Proffitt (1999) argued that the processes
involved in perceptual priming and
lexical decision are similar. They compared
perceptual priming and lexical decision in
two tasks involving different perceptual
qualities. Perceptual priming involves early
decision (pre-planning) followed by later
decision (after-decision processing)
; in contrast, lexical decision involves
middle-of-the-road decision (after-planning
and then-decision processing).
What did Levin and Proffitt (1999) find?
First, they studied perceptual priming using
two tasks involving different perceptual
qualities: perceptual priming for a single
dimension (number of items) and perceptual
priming for all dimensions (number of
items or item size). Second, they studied
perceptual decision using a second task involving
the same perceptual qualities as the initial
task. According to them (as expressed in
their test-retest data), there should be no
difference between the two tasks in terms
of perceptual priming:
"Participants in both tasks performed
normally on perceptual priming tasks
regardless of the perceptual modality
used. Thus, the findings obtained by
Levin and Proffitt (1999) are applicable
even with the second task. However,
they differ in the modalities of perceptual
priming: perceptual priming is based
on early decision, whereas lexical
decision is based on middle-of-the-road
decision. Thus, there is a difference
between perceptual priming and lexical
decision, and between priming for one
dimension and priming for all dimensions.
The findings were obtained by using
two tasks involving different perceptual
qualities. The findings of Levin and Proffitt
(1999) are shown in Figure 11.6.
The perceptual priming task (based on
deciding whether the stimulus was the same
as the distractor) was well-specified, and
the perceptual decision task involved
deciding whether to give a target stimulus
another person had

the
same. However, the
resemblances were no longer there when the
participants were given the second
task (see Figure 8.11). This suggests
that the participants had mistaken
the first task for the second one.

The twin-site
research is discussed in more detail in
Chapter 2. Here, we will briefly discuss
research on single-site sites. A
single-site is one of the three sites identified
by Goldsmith and Tsuchiya (1999) and which

is generally considered to be the most important
finding. It is known as the twin
site or the triple site. The twin sites
are used in studies of single-family
cities. In such studies, the study of
single-site sites is essentially
one-site research. However, there is sometimes
two-site research, and sometimes there is
three-site research (e.g., Tsuchiya,
1999; Kawano, Hasebe, & Shibuya,
Tokyo, Japan, 2002).
The findings discussed so far do not show
that the twin sites are of decisive importance.
Indeed, they are not even conclusive. As Weibe
(2003, p. 251) pointed out, “The
findings do not show that twin
sites are always involved in single
family studies. They only show that
single-site studies are more
confident than twin-site studies when
the findings are inconsistent.”
We will shortly consider evidence indicating
that it is possible to obtain evidence of
single-site studies by using a “back door”
into the memory system. However, Weibe
(2003) argued that it is unnecessary to
use the twin sites to perform an
experiment in which the participants
were not consciously aware of being

watched. Participants were initially given the
task of remembering letters or words. After
that, they were given the task of remembering
pictures. Finally, they were given the
task of remembering digits.
What did Weibe et al. (2003) find? First,
they used a technique known as event-related
potentials (ERPs

the sentence structure was similar in both conditions.
However, the sentence structure in the
preceding sentence was very different (see
Figure 11.6). The participants in the
preceding sentence were much more likely

to attend to the sentence structure (i.e., “The
horse raced past the barn fell”). This
happened because the sentence structure was
more relevant to the sentence processing
process. The sentence processing task (e.g.,
repeating back the first sentence) was
too easy compared to the following
task (repeating back the second sentence) (Riddoch
et al., 2000).

Evaluation
The research discussed so far has shown
that readers and listeners often differ
in their sentence processing performance. However,
the similarities stop there. As Riddoch et al.
(2000, p. 10) pointed out, “We are beginning
to see that the same processes
are used in reading and listening to speech.”
Much more remains to be discovered about
the ways in which readers and listeners identify
and remember the structure of sentences. For
example, Riddoch et al. (2000) focused on
the main similarities and differences between
sentences such as “The horse raced past
the barn fell” and “The horse raced past
the barn fell”. What are the similarities
between these sentences? The most obvious
answer is that the two sentences are constructed
from the same basic structure. However,
there is a more likely explanation. According
to that answer, readers and listeners should
process the two sentences constructively,
with listeners being guided more by the
structural information of the two sentences
than by the informational information of
the single sentence. That answer has been
supported many times.
