black target and white distractor stimuli
were presented simultaneously. There was
a learning curve in the learning of which
target was appropriate and which was not,
as predicted by the constraint-based theory.
However, the learning curve did not exist in
the conditioning condition. The findings of
Riddoch et al. (2006) are shown in
Figure 9.3. There was clear evidence
of the learning curve in the acquisition
curve. There was also clear evidence
of the extinction curve in the recognition
curve. The findings are shown in
red. From Riddoch et al. (2006).

of the acquisition curve but not of the
recognition curve. Thus, the acquisition
curve does not exist in the sense that target
is always found.

Evaluation
The constraint-based theory has proved
very successful in two important ways.
First, it explains very clearly the acquisition
curve. Second, it provides a very
accurate account of many phenomena
(e.g., recognising a target as a member
of the category to which it belongs;
recognising that there is an important
distinction between familiar and unfamiliar
objects).
What are the limitations of constraintbased
theory? First, it is not entirely correct
to regard the acquisition and recognition
curves as uniquely determined by the
observer’s perceptual system. Several
of the processes involved in perceptual
generalisation (e.g., context-based effects;
perceptual integration) can be influenced
by the observer’s actions.
Second, it may be less correct to
identify the different components
of the acquisition and recognition curves as
separately important than the various
processes involved in perceptual
generalisation. There are many
factors influencing the two acquisition
curves. However, it is generally
accepted that the acquisition curve is
mainly determined by context. Several
findings are discussed shortly.
Third, the notion that the acquisition
curve is determined by the observer’s actions
is oversimplified. It is likely that there
are also individual differences in the
mechanisms of processing different kinds
of stimulus. For example, there are
probably more dopamine receptors in
the prefrontal cortex of human observers
perceived in stimulus-driven conditions
than in stimulus-controlled conditions (Lenneberg
et al., 1994). However, it has proved hard
to find consistent evidence that the
acquisition curve is determined by the
observer’s actions.

Which brain regions are involved in perceptual
generalisation? According to the theory,
the medial superior temporal gyrus (especially
the temporoparietal junction) is of special
importance. Why is that? The temporoparietal
junction is involved because it is involved
in long-term memory and is of importance
in semantic memory. According to the
constraint-based approach (e.g., Riddoch et al.,
2006), all the information needed to perform
perceptual tasks is stored in the prefrontal cortex.
However, Riddoch and Culham (1993)
applied functional neuroimaging to the temporoparietal
junction and found that there was greater
activation in the right frontal region when perceptual
generalisation tasks were being performed
than when they were not (see Figure 9.3).
