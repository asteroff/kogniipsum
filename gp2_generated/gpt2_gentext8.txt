is concerned with the functions of the specialised
parts of the brain (location-based, vision-for-perception, phonological, and motion-based), and the additional one is concerned with
awareness.

Location-based thinking: this involves making
use of generalisations and adjustments to
the information available to the central
cortex.
Plato had emphasised the role of the
central executive in Plaut et al.’s (1999)
(reprinted in Chapter 6). The central
executive is involved in planning and executing
actions (e.g., reaching for a pint of beer),
and in planning and executing actions that
perform a particular function (e.g., reaching for
a pint of beer).

====================
What is
the role of consciousness in perceptual organisation?
According to Kintsch, Welsch, and Zimny (2001),
conscious awareness of threat-related stimuli in
auditory and visual perception depends on integrated processing within the temporal and parietal lobes. In contrast, what is more controversial is the
extent to which the vision-forperception system is associated with conscious awareness of visual threat.
According to Kintsch et al. (p. 100), “The visuo-spatial
sensory system . . . is associated with the visionfor-action system, a sensory-binocular network, with
a visual buffer that carries out visual stimuli in
parallel, and a visual display buffer that carries
out visual stimuli in a serial fashion.”
Evidence that the visuo-spatial sketchpad and the
visual buffer both have input features parallel to
that of the vision-for-perception system was
reported by Zwaan and Radvansky (1998). A
videotape of the event was made of approaching
a target, of which there was a target event in the

visual buffer and a target hearth event in the
serial buffer. On some trials, the buffer
was full of errors and scrambled up a list
of words unrelated to the event, whereas
on other trials it was empty. The key finding was
that on some trials the buffer was full of
errors and scrambled up a list of words
unrelated to the event, whereas on other
trials it was empty.
What do the above findings mean?
First, the visuo-spatial sketchpad typically
stores several kinds of information, and so
it is not clear why it is so limited in its capacity.
Second, the lack of competition between
the information available on the serial and
parallel systems is consistent with the notion
of a vision-for-perception system.
Third, the visuo-spatial sketchpad may
have limited capacity because it is involved
in the integration of information from the
visual environment and the memory test
computer.

most of the knowledge available about vision

theoretical approach is based on the assumption that
the various components of the

system are all reasonably interconnected.
According to this assumption, it is
very important for the various pieces to operate
separately. Suppose you agree to assist
in the retrieval of information from
the various components. However, the retrieval
of information from each component would
depend on the demands of all three components

argument that it is probably not a coincidence
that the strength of links is only four!
(1) An alternative (or strong) one?
Strong links make it easier for people to make
alternative decisions. They also help to increase the
number of people choosing to make a choice
in the real world. The availability of resources
is what allows a person to make successful
decisions. However, the strength of the alternative
decision may not be very great because many
people are very good at making decisions on their
own. For example, Jon Coch, who is 23 years
old, made a successful decision to move from
Beverly Hills to Los Angeles with a savings of
$100. However, he later made a similar decision
to move from Bembijk to Los Angeles with
a profit of $15. He had spent his entire
life savings in risky risky risky risky risky
 risky decision making, and so it is reasonable
that it would take him longer to make the
same decision twice. Jon was wronged by his
high school coach, and so his ability to make
risky risky decisions was severely impaired.
Thus, risky risky decisions were often made
shortly before risky risky risky decisions were
made, and so Jon was poor at making risky
risky decisions.

learning ability, but it has since been

As Jon learned business school, his ability to

Experimental cognitive psychology
Colin Moriarty (1988, 1996) developed and extended this theory, with
also providing convincing evidence that
prior attention is necessary for object recognition.
According to the theory, object recognition
is influenced by the shifts in the spatial and
temporal resolution of an observer’s
field as he/she moves around a virtual environment.
According to the dual-process model,
perception is influenced by the shift in temporal
and spatial awareness of a visual stimulus,
and so by the shifting of the observer’s gaze from
to see the ground. Some of the key issues relating
to perception and attention were discussed
earlier (see Chapter 16).
The research discussed so far was limited,
because it involved assessing only part of the
story of visual perception. It also involved
using very general cognitive tests, which
did not require aspects of the story. As
we will see, this is only approximately correct.
Further problems arose because observers
can shift attention very rapidly from the visual
display to a far distant one. This led
to problems for the experimenter’s goals,
and the experimenters were often illogical in their predictions. Thus, a crucial
assumption was that the experimenters’ theories
had been remarkably consistent in their
reactions to visual stimuli.
Cooke, Peel, Shaw, and Watson (2005)
studied a patient with damage to the premotor
cortex. This patient was presented with flickering
and abrupt changes in the shapes of three
different shapes (figure 1a). When presented
with the flickering shapes, he often seemed lost
at the same three-dimensional shapes, suggesting
that he was processing the visual stimuli in the
latter world. This patient was also found to
have impaired short-term memory (see
Figure 2.7).
Sio and Wolfe (2005) pointed out that
this patient had suffered damage to the
parietal and temporal lobes. If so, this
patient would suffer from various kinds of
cognitive impairment, including perceptual
deafness, neglect, and extinction.

====================
theoretical approach
to understanding human cognition. It is based on
the assumption that, “reasoning is knowledge” (Madison
& Radvansky, 1987). The main task in
intelligent design behaviour is to find ways
to minimise the potential for error.

Information
Theories of cognition
such as those put forward by Evans (1997,
2005) or by Monti (e.g., 1996) argue
that the key issue is whether the outputs of
intelligent design experiments are sound or
incomplete. There are various reasons why
tasks such as this fail to produce accurate
diagnostics. First, the errors typically
occur due to problems with timing,
and that makes it hard to know when some
wrong result will be forthcoming. Second,
the errors typically follow at a rapid rate
of forgetting which led to the original
plan. As a result, it is very hard to think
in logical terms.
Information processing
Much of the time we make use of previous
knowledge or experience to solve problems.
This is fine in journalism, but often happens in
attentionally wandering mouse-and-table-land. How
can we increase the efficiency of our processing?
According to Evans (1997, p. 392), “We
may well . . . make use of the resources of
the laboratory to solve familiar problems
inspiring the common man’s beliefs and laws.”
We do this by requiring certain knowledge and actions to be
endeavourably accompanied by those knowledge and actions
causing behaviour problems for the experimenter.
Poldrack (1957) proposed a similar
approach to this problem, and found that participants spent longer inspectingpicture of their
own personality (making decisions relevant
to their current goals).
Additional evidence suggesting that we do
notarchicaliseiseise well is found
in everyday conversation, in conversations involving
various people, and in laboratory research.

We will start by considering the processes
involved in the initial stages of problem solving.
Some of the main processes involved in

the two groups did not differ in their

general knowledge of the objects (control

group). However, the two groups did differ
in their comprehension abilities. This indicates that the two tasks involved
individuals rarely interact with each other.
The ability of shadowing to detect target
information differs considerably depending
on whether the task involves accessing it directly,
or indirectly, via neural correlates
(see Chen & Klahr, 2008, for a review).
The requirement that participants respond
rapidly was a limitation of the initial study
and Chen and Klahr used a multiple-task
model to account for this ability. However,
the additional task of using multiple sources of
information (e.g., contextual information)
is discussed in more detail later.

events and experiences, and so it is not surprising that
they are often stored in long-term memory.
However, in practice, what is surprising is
whether retrospective memory processes are
estimated fairly rapidly and automatically or
frequently and almost never occurs. This is because
we typically want to be certain that our
judgements are valid, whereas our
judgements of others are.
How different are prospective and retrospective memory processes? As Baddeley (1997) pointed
out, retrospective memory generally involves
remembering what we know about something
and can be high in informational content. In
contrast, prospective memory typically focuses
on when to do something, and has low informational content. The low informational
content helps to ensure that any failures to
perform the prospective memory task are not
due to retrospective memory failures. The
usefulness of prospective memory for inductive reasoning has been
suggested by Hannula (1996; see
Figure 8.7).
Hannula and Piercy (2002) argued that
tasks that involve prospective memory are
:
(1) Retrospective memory task: produce and
testibly recall items from long recall;
but the actual task is not known.

(2) Task-based prospective memory task:
remember to give each item specific
reasons for remembering (e.g., remembering being in
the same room with the same person).
(3) Retrospective memory task: to perform
a memory test when absent from the group.
(4) Context-based prospective memory task:
to perform a memory test when in the same
place as the participant’s intentions.

Disorders of attention
According to the dual-task hypothesis, attentional
processes are associated with consciousness.
Dual-task conditions with no apparent dualtask conditions produce dissimilar findings. Thus, a double dissociation may be
caused by the requirement to shift emphasis from one taskto another.
According to the dual-task hypothesis, it is better to
task in co-ordinated attention rather than in
unordinated attention.

•

Automatic processing
Patients with damage to the primary visual
cortex often show poor ability to perform
visual tasks (e.g., tracing a piece of paper) on
those tasks. Patients with damage to the primary
visual cortex often show the opposite pattern. This
finding is consistent with the notion that
there is more co-ordination of processing
(or processing) tasks than previously believed.

•

Automatic processing
Visual tasks impaired conscious awareness
because of an impaired frontal-parietal
network. Brain-damaged patients showed impaired
conscious awareness when a task was presented on its own or at the same time as another task
in the same location. This pattern of findings was not found when a secondary task (e.g., tracing a scarf) was presented on its own
or at the same time as a task in a different location.

•

Inhibition hypothesis
The hypothesis that under-report of visual
attention reduces conscious awareness is as
well-supported as the claimed inhibition of negative
attention. According to this hypothesis, selective attentional processes are damaged in patients
with damage to the frontal cortex. Damage to
the frontal cortex can produce an opposite
pattern to the inhibition pattern, but this reversal of attentional processes is more likely
when there is extensive neglect of stimuli
presented to a dissimilar location. According to the
opportunity condition, patients should have recovered fully
when a task was performed on its own but at
the same time as a task in another location.

6 LEARNING , MEMORY, AND FORGETTING 221
productive thinking is associated with the
use of numerous cognitive processes. As
discussed earlier, Riddoch and Humphreys
(1975) argued that the reproductive system
can be regarded as a kind of cognitive
disruption. A cognitive psychologist is
supposed to be doing something productive
(encoding), but actually doing so in the
absence of a cognitive process (making use
of his/her limited capacity). What is of
most importance is the reproductive system’s
ability to generate hypotheses (and to
make sense of the evidence) through
a flexible method known as computational
disruption.
It is generally assumed that the reproductive
system has limited capacity (compared
to other cognitive systems) and that it takes longer
to produce conclusions. Evidence reviewed by
Riddoch and Humphreys (1975) indicates
that the reproductive system is often of major
importance in conclusions generation.
They used the example of a woman thinking
tomorrow and producing a conclusion this
seems very likely. The reproductive system
was able to generate several strongly
similar conclusions on its own (see Figure 6.
followed by a follow-up study on a different
goal on the night of the experiment). This
finding is more consistent with the notion
of a reproductive system than with the
traditional notion that a reproductive
system has.
How can we explain the above phenomenon?
A most likely explanation is that we
hang onto information processed through the
first stage of processing (the retrieval
stage). This information is then beamed to
conscious awareness via the retrieval of
some fraction of the equation (the
addition or addition stage). It is assumed
that the retrieval of information via the
addition stage is more useful than the retrieval
of information on the plus side.

presented has a direct impact on the cognitive
processes involved in perception and memory.

declarative memory: memory that does not
enable the recall of factual memories; see
inductive memory.

Most memory errors occur when a stimulus
becomes part of the memory representation rather
than immediately before the stimulus. For example,
a flashback to a previous episode is a flashback
to an episode that preceded and followed the
first episode of a preceding week. A flashback
of the week before the week of the week of
the most recent week is a week of significance
to the participant.

Evidence
Baddeley and Andrade (2000) reported evidence
for the involvement of declarative memory in
episodic memory. They showed a video to see
what was shown, and asked participants to recall
the video presented before or after the event.
There was a sharp increase in the number of sharp
words in the week before the event, but the
unprecedented high scores showed no effect on
episodic memory. In contrast, there was
a moderate increase in the week before the
event with no effect on episodic memory.
The most dramatic finding of the study
by Baddeley and Andrade (2000) was
that very few participants showed a direct
impact on episodic memory. This finding, we
consider, depends on the precise details of
what is going on in the brain.

NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
Cognitive neuropsychology is concerned with
the patterns of cognitive performance (intact
and impaired) shown by brain-damaged patients.
These patients have suffered lesions – structural
alterations within the brain caused by injury or
disease. According to cognitive neuropsychologists,
the study of brain-damaged patients can tell
us much about normal human cognition. We
can go further. As McCloskey (2001, p. 594)
pointed out, “Complex systems often reveal
their inner workings more clearly when they
are malfunctioning than when they are running
smoothly.” He described how he only began
to discover much about his laser printer when
it started misprinting things.
We can gain insight into the cognitive neuropsychological approach by considering a braindamaged patient (AC) studied by Coltheart,
Inglis, Cupples, Michie, Bates, and Budd (1998).
AC was a 67-year-old man who had suffered
several strokes, leading to severe problems with
object knowledge. If we possess a single system
for object knowledge, then AC should be severely
impaired for all aspects of object recognition.
That is not what Coltheart et al. found. AC

====================
The study by Schacter and
Addis (2007) was limited in that the
sex of the participants was not taken into
account. More recent research has indicated
that the study was a bit more ecological
in that the penguins were not taken into
account.

Evaluation
The ecological approach to cognition has
many successes to its credit. The ecological
context is often more informative than the
ecological one, and there is generally more
research devoted to clarifying the relationship
between the two kinds of context.
The ecological approach has several limitations.
First, the ecological approach is generally oversimplified. Consider the
study by Schacter and Addis (2007). They
studied pilot birds who had to make difficult
turns while hauling fruits
in a field. The participants were mostly
human participants, so there was little
context in the data. Second, the experiment by
Schacter and Addis (2007) was designed to

result from the early 1980s. As such, it is unlikely
that the experiment by Schacter and Addis
has had a very rapid impact on the data
they provided. Third, the experiment by
Schacter and Addis was designed to produce
recall effects that would last through the
life of the bird. Fourth, the ecological
context only partially explained the findings by
Schacter and Addis (2007). The context
may have played a part in producing the
recall effect, but it is not clear to what
the ecological explanation was.

Evaluation
There are various reasons for accepting
the ecological validity of most of
the research by which we discuss cognitive
neuroscience. First, the findings are often
relatively clearer than people imagine. Second,
the cognitive neuroscience approach has
shown that cognitive neuroscientists can
provide important new insights into the
brain functions that are important to us humans. Third, the cognitive
neuroscience approach has made substantial
improvements in performance.
What are the limitations of the cognitive
neuroscience approach? First, it is generally
assumed that the cognitive performance of braindamaged and intact

are similar, that brain damage is a serious problem
and that the brain functions that are needed
to perform well on tasks. However, as
we will see, this is not always the case.
Second, it is generally
====================
The first stage of the
repetition process is to process the word “beef”.
This word is preceded by a noun, a verb,
and a noun pair (e.g., “They were both sheep”).
The verb is used to indicate that the noun
is the main character from the sentence and the
noun pair. The context allows us to shift
towards the verb by indicating that the noun
is the main subject of the sentence.
The verb is used to indicate, “Some of the
strongest willedness and most devoted life
is prepared for by the willing obedience of
some one to the consequences of their actions
(Beef & Goodale, 1992).” Thus, the verb is
used when someone says, “Some of the strongest willed
life is prepared for by the willing obedience of
some one to the consequences of their actions”.
The second stage of the process is bonding
(i.e., we try to enhance one’s own).
This involves bonding emotionally between
the speaker and the listener.
The first stage of bonding involves
distraction (Knowlton, 2002). We are more
likely to disengage emotionally when distracted
because we have less time to process what
is being said. Distractedibility also means
that listening to a speaker while listening to someone else is less likely to suffer if the
speaker continues to speak.
The third stage of the process is communication (Knowlton,
2002). We spend more time communicating than
spoken language, and this is more so with questions and
stories. It is easier to communicate what we
want to say (because we attach more weight
to what we know).

LANGUAGE CHANGES
There are important language skills learned through
practice in close proximity to the speaker.
Most language is learned in a simple and effortful
way, and there are few cues to speech
level. However, cues to speech level can be
learned out of language itself (Lachter, 2001).
Cues to speech level are usually formed when
someone uses a familiar or familiar strategy to
reach a conclusion that is useful or appropriate
for the situation. For example, it is socially
demanding to make demands on the availability
of something (e.g., buying it at

and maintenance of autobiographical memories.
Lachter et al. (2004) identified three
areas in the prefrontal cortex associated with
the central executive:
• Task-based central executive: This is
involved in the central executive itself, which
is concerned with long-term memory;
it is the main function of the central
executive.
• Substantial component of working memory: This
is concerned with specific cognitive functions (e.g.,
working memory capacity); it is the component
of working memory concerned with self-monitoring.
• Strategic component of working memory concerned with
self-judgement; it is used when performance
targets the central executive.
• Engaging component of working memory concerned with problem solving.
• It is used when a solution is reached in
a difficult situation.
• Low-level component of working memory concerned with
mental arithmetic; it is used when problems
are solved in terms of minimal numbers of
items or by changing the meanings of
words.
• Low-level component of working memory
involved in problem-solving; it is used when
problems arise in which the use of working
memory is important.
• Engaging component of working memory
involved in integrating information
from attention and working memory.
• Problem-solving component of working
memory concerned with problem solving;
it is used when a solution is reached in
difficult situations.
What are the limitations of research
on the three executive processes? First, it is
difficult to study the effects of the central
executive and the problem-solving component
on each other. It is also possible that the
combining executive and problem-solving
components are more likely to lead to successful
cognitive strategies.
Second, the research has only just uncovered
the underlying processes – it is too early to provide
a definitive answer. Third, the ways in
which the prefrontal cortex is involved in
cognitive psychology are still somewhat unclear.
However, the notion that prefrontal cortex

NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
Cognitive neuropsychology is concerned with
the patterns of cognitive performance (intact
and impaired) shown by brain-damaged patients.
These patients have suffered lesions – structural
alterations within the brain caused by injury or
disease. According to cognitive neuropsychologists,
the study of brain-damaged patients can tell
us much about normal human cognition. We
can go further. As McCloskey (2001, p. 594)
pointed out, “Complex systems often reveal
their inner workings more clearly when they
are malfunctioning than when they are running
smoothly.” He described how he only began
to discover much about his laser printer when
it started misprinting things.
We can gain insight into the cognitive neuropsychological approach by considering a braindamaged patient (AC) studied by Coltheart,
Inglis, Cupples, Michie, Bates, and Budd (1998).
AC was a 67-year-old man who had suffered
several strokes, leading to severe problems with
object knowledge. If we possess a single system for object knowledge, then AC should be severely
impaired for all aspects of object recognition.
That is not what Coltheart et al. found. AC
seemed to possess practically no visual information

about objects (e.g., the colours of animals;
whether certain species possess legs). However,
AC was right 95% of the time when classifying
animals as dangerous or not and had a 90%
success rate when deciding which animals are
normally eaten. He was also right over 90%
of the time when asked questions about auditory
perceptual knowledge of animals (“Does it

the
central executive deficit patients.
According to the model, performance
on the central executive deficit task should benefit
from having several executive processes in addition to the one used by the patients. However, there is
more to it than meets the eye. According to
the model, the central executive deficit patient should
have severe problems with both the phonological
and visuospatial tasks, whereas the
patients at the front of the brain scanner should have
severe problems with the phonological task.
What is most striking about the
two studies is that the phonological task was
emphasised, and the patients did not
have direct evidence of the importance of
phonological processing.
What is most striking about the

processing.
What is less surprising is that the visuo-spatial
task (detecting when two consecutive
words are in the same word) was
emphasised, and the scores were both very
low. However, the findings are in line
with the model. The phonological task
was moderately effective, but the visual
task (detecting when two words are in the same
word) was not. Note that the findings
were similar in the two conditions, with
the phonological task making use of more
active visual processing and the visuo-spatial
task using less time available.

Evaluation
The dual-task approach has various strengths.
First, it is based on the assumption that
two tasks can be performed very independently.
Second, there is more research on dual-task
performance than you can shake a stick at.
Third, there are clear links between the
two tasks and various central executive
processes. and, most importantly, these
are also used in complex, serial tasks.
What are the limitations of the dual-task
approach? First, we lack a detailed account of why and how

we engage in complex, serial or elaborative dual-task
performance. It is also not entirely clear
why we show some response adaptation in serial
task performance even when those tasks
are relatively easy. Second, it is not entirely
clear why dual-task performance is so
early and fast on some tasks and so late

the study of human cognition by
experts and experts. It is a fruitful field
because it involves trying to understand the
laws of human cognition as written down
in long-form text form, and because it is influenced
by social context. The study of human
cognition by experts has produced impressive
data and hypotheses. Indeed, as Bub
and Logothetis (2008, p. 304) pointed out, “It
seems likely that the most important characteristics
of experts are extensive and seemingly
effortless, insight is common, and the
results of most cognitive neuroimaging studies
are often only theologically questionable.”

Introduction
Cognitive neuropsychology is an exciting field, with
many exciting findings to whet the appetite.
However, the most exciting findings have
been reported from patients whose brain damage
affected their everyday functioning.
In this section, we will consider a patient,
D, who had damage to the right frontal
lobe and the right dorsolateral prefrontal
lobe. His ability to use his right index
finger to move his own hands was dramatically
reduced following a bout of Parkinson’s disease.
However, his ability to use his left index
finger to move his own hands was not
reduced as his ability to use his left index
finger to move his own hands was impaired.
Thus, there are important differences between
Parkinson’s disease and its associated symptoms
(germating).
What is research on human cognition?
It is important to study cognitive neuropsychology,
to identify potential patients, and to identify
the underlying mechanisms causing impaired performance on cognitive tasks. For example, we would

often assume that a given patient’s cognitive
performance is unaffected by a condition
such as that of which he is currently

9/23/10 Most concepts require a delay
to identify with, and so it is not very
difficult to decide whether the naming of
words is correct. However, it is more difficult
to name faces when the stimuli are very
distinct (e.g., that person is famous; he/she
is known as a “f”). Earlier we pointed out that
there is a bottleneck in the processing of
100 ms stimuli. If we try to take in
the full meaning of a sentence as it
is presented, the processing of the sentence
may suffer from the associated slowing
effect (e.g., “Broke Bell is broken”).
This slowing effect is known as the
latent versus prospective memory effect.
Evidence that we need to monitor our
reading ability closely is discussed in the
preface to the third edition of the Cambridge
studies. We will mention two general limitations
(see Figure 9.2). First, the reading of
numbers, strings of letters, and digits aloud
is very slow. Second, prospective memory
effect means that the speed of phonological processing
is poor. However, the accuracy of the audi-

tion of an utterance depends very much on
the reliability of the intention to whom
the utterance is spoken (e.g., “You
have done an excellent job at picking up
the telephone”).
Third, the emphasis has been on the
proportional interference effects of word
frequency on prospective memory. However,
what is at issue is how this information is
combined with information
