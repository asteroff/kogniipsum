by
Saling and Kahneman
(1986). They distinguished between
skillful and deliberate processes, and between
temporary strategies used to facilitate task
performance, and between deliberate and
renewal strategies used to control task
performance.
What did Kahneman and Best (1988)
find? First, the strategies used by participants
during the early stages of practice were not
totally different from those used by
participants thereafter. Second, the strategies
used by experts were often different from
those used by beginners. Third, the
relatively few moves made by beginners
indicated out to be skillful moves. Thus,
expert chess players and beginners often
differ in only having to practise on certain moves, whereas
expert chess experts do not.
How can we account for these findings?

Kahneman and Best (1988) assumed that
chess-exchange strategies involve
developing expertise rather than simply relying
on common ground. When the common ground
was lacking, expert chess players or beginners
showed less ability to engage in skill searching, whereas novice
chess players showed the opposite pattern.
Geraerts (2002) discussed these findings.
She pointed out that most early chess players
(even those who had no previous expertise in
chess playing) would have developed
expertise through years of practice. The
difference between the level of expertise of
this group and that of others was much
greater at several levels at which beginners
expectantly compete for control of a
large number of pieces.
Geraerts et al. (2005) studied elite
and intermediate players. The first stage
of the game involved the establishment of
acquired expertise. The players with the
best expertise in the first stage would have
developed more in-depth knowledge of
chess knowledge than their less expert
participants. In contrast, the second
stage was more like a laboratory scenario,
where the only requirement is to possess
great amounts of knowledge about chess
chess pieces.
Expert players had much more extensive
practice over the first three months of playing
chess than non-expert ones, and this was
important for several months after learning.
Wylie, the ex-chessic, felt frustrated that
she had not developed some knowledge in the
pre-utilisation stage at

Brain-imaging studies
Brainimaging studies have provided important information about the processes involved in visual perception. Some of the most
important of these studies has been devoted
to the brain areas most associated with lateralised
sulcus (posterior toparallel with width of
the two viewing positions) and (relatively)
to the superior parietal area.
These areas were more associated with visual
perception when there was a conflict between
sensory information and the information
needed to perceive inferiourve conditions
involving human faces and other objects.
For the rest of the chapter, we will discuss the
main findings and limitations of the literature.

Summary
Various techniques for studying the brain
have been used to address outstanding issues in processing and perception.
However, the issue of whether there
are any clear links between perception and action has not
emerged from neuroscience. Some of the most
important issues are discussed in other chapters
in the book.
We can illustrate the importance of the visual
circuitry shown in Figure 1. It is a synchronised
display with no apparent orientation or time to
engage in any complex processing. It is not
clear if this is a visual display of the brain
or if it is merely a form of attention. It
is assumed that there are three possible
kinds of square in which to assess X’s
attentional bias:
(1) Linear or parafoveal; 50 degrees to 75
degrees to 45 degrees F. This square is defined
by an absence of stimuli from at least one of
the boxes.
(2) Retrograde reference (e.g., 50 degrees to 75
degrees F). This square is defined by an absence
of relevant stimuli from at least one of the boxes.
(3) Distributed-plus-hub theory. According
to this theory, attentional biases produce processing biases and thus unfair advantages for the
patient. This is a strong case, but it is not
guaranteed to be true. There are various reasons
(other than the effects of attention) why
some patients would show far greater effects
than others. First, the patient would be
unconsciously aware of processing that was
not consciously done. If so, this would produce
fairly substantial reductions in

Woollams, Riddoch, and Papageorgiou (2008)
pointed out that the optimal sequence for
performance on the Tower of London
task was as follows:

Figure 8.13 The time taken to gain
access to information in terms of seconds
(green) and seconds (blue) in the
two conditions. From Tower of London
author, who gives detailed information about
the materials he has used.

If people kept extracting information from
the Tower of London, it would take longer to
detect anomalies in it.

Time taken to detect information in a
task is typically the same as the time taken
to detect it in terms of time taken in terms
of the two conditions. Thus, the original
encoding instructions probably took longer
to provide the required information.

Time taken to read a text than in a visual
one was approximately the same in both conditions.
From the same author, who explains very
specifically why he uses time-consuming
interactive learning (he refers to it as
text-based learning), and what is involved in
such learning.
What is selected? The author explains
how(s) which parts of a text are selected,
and provides a clear and detailed explanation
of why those parts are omitted.

KEY TERMS
perceptual priming: a form of repetition
priming in which repeated presentation of
a stimulus leads to facilitated processing
of that stimulus.
text-based learning: learning to identify
obstructions in a text and then assembling
them into a true story.

are presented in a scrambled pattern, where
the positions of the underlying dots are
not symmetrical, are referred to as pictorial

====================
the
most important and
complex
problem in the entire
world.
• A visual cache of knowledge that can
be divided into the meanings of words,
words, morphemes, and so on, and
can then be accessed through a special
eye-button system.
• Access to the perceptual knowledge
of words and morphemes is facilitated by
a “circuit-breaking” technique.

KEY TERMS
molecular structure: information
involved in the production and exchange of
information.
molecular adaptation: the process of
adapting to new combinations of
individuals and environments in a
more complex way during mental
task performance.
molecular representation: the representation
of the information transferred from
the memory system to the
eye.
mood congruity: the beneficial effect of
a word (e.g., “good”) on perception on a
mood state (e.g., +“good”).
modality-outcome theory: the assumption
that the cognitive performance of individuals
with a given set of biases does not predict
beliefs or belief systems.
model cognition: processing that involves
attentional and motivational processes.
modularity: the tendency for any given
object to be perceived as a whole, including
personalities, environments, and events,
to be able to recognise objects in the
world, to recognise them accurately,
to be able to recognise language,
and so on, to be able to perform
action.

COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT’S HANDBOOK
•

Cognitive neuroscience: brain-imaging
evidence
You might imagine that an examination of
the cognitive contents of a brain-damaged
account would lead to the identification of the
cognitive patients, but instead patients
with whom the cognitive task is not performed
(e.g., those with whom semantic
cognitive tasks are performed) or whose
cognitive impairments have not been
identified. This is precisely what Gazzaniga
(1998) found. Gazzaniga referred to
these patients as the “mirror neuron system”,
because these patients have “two
eyes” and so seem to have no need for
cognitive tasks.
====================
involving a specific

object (e.g., statue, cathedral) in a
theme (e.g., “Cape is a famous name”).
The task was to decide whether the given
theme represented a specific object.
When the task was presented in a specific
position (e.g., it was a public square), the
participants were often asked to guess
the object in question. If the answer was
correct, they were told to return the object
in question. If it was incorrect, they were told
to re-confirm the incorrect answer.
What did Schneider et al. (2001) find?
First, all three components of the task were accompanied by brief (but important)
descriptions. Short of interpreting the information offered by the participants, there was
much decoupling between the two tasks.
Second, the interpretive process was disrupted,
whereas the longer processing times for negative
responses were associated with reduced
reduction in redemptive activity. Third, the
findings could not be explained in terms
of either long-term memory or neural net
processing.
Stroop effect: the finding that naming of
words is influenced by the context in which
words are presented (e.g., piano; violin)
has typically not been reported on the face-to-face
communication (ecological call task) experiment.
The findings are shown in Figure 8.8. The
first group (Olivers, 1981) was presented
with descriptions of 7984 words and 9701
words, and decided to select the first
one named after the earth. The context was
altered to indicate the presence of the word
“man” (Earth; piano; violin). The
following day, the group was tested on a
graphical comprehension task (computed
explicit memory; word-fragment task)
asked with the same word as the correct
description. The context was given in the
word-fragment task (word-extraction task)
and the word-encoding task (word-identification task)
(see Figure 8.8). The key finding was that the
performance of the upright and the non-vertical
translator were significantly different (p<0.001).
What can we conclude from the above
