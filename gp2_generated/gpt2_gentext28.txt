the key issue is whether
the processes involved in perception
of visual stimuli are similar in all visual
dimensions. Some theorists (e.g., Collette
et al., 2005; Osman, 2007) argue that
there is an important distinction between
perceptual and pictorial priming.
Perceptual priming occurs when a stimulus
is presented to the perceptual cortex and the
pictorial cortex both at the same time.
The specificity principle leads theorists to
contain pictorial and spatial images in a
faster-than-usual fashion. However, it is likely
that perceptual processing is more important
(as well as pictorial priming) than is generally
assumed in visual priming theories.
The specificity principle explains why
perceptual and pictorial priming seem to
interfere more often than perceptual or spatial
priming. More specifically, pictorial priming
occurs when the stimulus space is larger
than visual space, whereas spatial or visual
priming depend solely on word processing.
If word processing is involved in pictorial
priming, then word priming should occur
much earlier in visual perception than in visual
perception. If pictorial priming is also involved, then word
processing should take longer to occur than
in visual perception. If pictorial priming is also
involved, then visual perception should take longer
than auditory perception.
There is some evidence that more extensive
processing of stimulus features occurs in
visual than in visual perception. For example,
consider a study by Lindholm and Christianson
(1998). Auditory word identification was
performed on its own or with a virtual reality
chair in the presence of sentences varying
in length and in vocabulary. There was a
dichotically complex visual illusion (see Glossary)
that showed a gradual reduction in perceptual
information as processing slowed to a
moderate level. However, there was a greater
enormous reduction in auditory identification
when the virtual and auditory environments were
separate and unequal in terms of vocabulary.
Thus, perceptual information is transferred from
auditory perception to the virtual environments.

Levelt’s theoretical approach and
WEAVER++
Levelt (1979) proposed several of the processes
involved in visual perception, including
follow-up processes, co-ordination processes, and
lexical identification processes. These processes are
limited to the perceptual system itself and do
not require to involve the central executive.
Higashiyama and Adachi (2002) have gone
beyond simple perceptual processes to
contain perceptual information in the structural
network. They have combined perceptual
analysis with functional neuroimaging to provide the most comprehensive theoretical account of
visual perception.
Adkins (1995, 1999) put forward the most
influential theoretical approach based on the
combination of perceptual analysis and functional
neuroscience. He named this approach WEAVER++, after
ourselves (1997 Nobel Prize winner for
science), and his (1997) most influential (and
influential) theoretical approach is discussed
equally here.

Evidence
There has been controversy about the relationship between the attentional blink and the attentional blink, and whether
the two pathways are separate. According to Levelt
and Franklin (2002, p. 7), “The perceptual system is the neural gateway to the
higher self, the conceptual and conceptual pathways to the higher self, and the conceptual
and conceptual pathways to the lower self.”
It is important to consider the precise connections between the ventral and dorsal
pathways. For example, the ventral pathway is
involved in general cognitive processing, the
dorsal pathway in particular cases. Bartolomeo
and Chokron (1999 discussed a study on
the ventral pathway in which participants
tried to identify words passed their
eyes while performing a task. The participants
who were not consciously aware of the word
“cue were selected.” These participants
were only exposed to the word while performing
a particular task at the same time as the

task. In another study, Burton, Naccache,
Loewenstein, and de Haan (1998) asked
participants to perform two tasks at the same
time (single-task and dual-task). The task was
performed by a team of scientists working
together on a computerised version of the
Warhol revisionist history project. The
participants performed the tasks in the same
fashion as their colleagues, and showed good
coverage for all the necessary tasks.
