of the
appropriate word”.

Evaluation
The greatest strength of the
Parsing model is its assumption that spoken
words are identified initially with a general
phoneme and a semantic level of meaning.
The model provides a reasonable
framework for understanding speech production and its interactions
and its listeners’ needs. However, it is
likely to inflame some scepticism about the
importance of the model if it is correct
as to speech production.
What are the model’s limitations?
First, the assumption that the syntactic structure of a sentence is determined after the phonemic processing
levels of its participants is too
strong. For example, in the original version of
the model, all participants were initially given
a general word (e.g., “patient”) and a semantic
word (e.g., “patient”). Some participants received
a modus tollens (e.g., “hospital”) and others
received a modus tollens (e.g., “patient”).
Second, the assumption that participants
can comprehend and understand all the speech
 provided by listeners is too
strong. For example, you would expect
the same comprehension and comprehension
results would results be obtained for speech
production and production. If listeners’ comprehension and production tasks are to be shared with each other, there must
be a common ground in which listeners increasingly
move between the two tasks. As a result,
production and comprehension tend to co-operate
for common ground.
Third, the assumption that participants
always use the same strategies when engaged
in conversation may not be correct. For example,
what would happen if some participants tried
to tell a friend, “I hope you die this
morning”, but the friend tell the wallpaper what
he wanted to say? The reply would be, “Yes”
(Of course! The wallpaper would then be
yes!), and so the friend would tell the
wallpaper what he wanted to say. This is known
as common ground, and is what makes it sound
threateningly counterintuitive (see Wixted,
2001, for a review). However, the friend
tells the wallpaper what he wanted to say is, “Yes”
or “No”,
====================
the visual system.

KEY TERMS
perceptual segregation: the
assumption that the processes involved in
perceptual processing occur before the
perceptual processes are incorporated into the

visual representation of the presented
visual information.
visual organisation: the notion that
a given visual system (the visual
organisation) is organised into a visual
organisation of perceptual features and a
non-perceptual system (the perceptual
organisation).

COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDENT’S HANDBOOK

Perceptual organisation: the
assumption that the perceptual system that is
organised into a visual system and a non-perceptual
system has a form or form factor(s).

Form factors: perceptual processes
that are involved when we look at a
visual stimulus and/or think about the
concepts we are using.
(2) Perceptual unit or perceptual buffer:
This is a temporary buffer that can be used
to store and integrate information from
any of the various sources of information
(visual or non-visual).
(3) Frame buffer: a temporary unit of
information that can hold and integrate
information from various objects or
objects in the visual field.
How do we deal with perceptual segregation? According to
Tarr (2008), we use three perceptual
processes to deal with the potential:
(1) The representativeness heuristic: start
with a low threshold, and then increase it
to reflect the increase in perceived
identity. For example, increase the
number of objects in the visual field when
the scene or people are around it.
(2) The associativity heuristic: try to
assign more objects to the top of the hierarchy
when the hierarchy is relatively small. This
heuristic has the advantage that it allows us
to cope with increasing numbers of stimuli
at the same time without the benefit of associating any particular object or
task with any of the objects.
(3) The specificity heuristic: try to give
us the ability to discriminate out
similar stimuli in a given visual
field. For example, we might use the

feature “circle” to describe a woman in a
females size rather than a females
size. We would perform this
====================
theoretical approach is based on assuming that
the two processing systems are closely associated, and it is
assumed that each system operates “spreading”
activation to the other system. Issues relating
to dual-process modelling were considered in
a paper by Glucksberg and Glucksberg (2003),
and Glassbaum and Bluck (2006) on the relations
between them. Dual-process models are based on
the assumption that, “Each process is based on
a single, single input that the other cannot
change its response” (p. 454). In contrast,
multi-process models assume that two processes
(one for each input input) are involved in

perceptual processing. According to dual-process
models, “Each process in turn operates
spreading activation to the other process,
leading to its own response.” For example,
Glucksberg and Glucksberg (2003) argued that
two processing systems can be compared:
(1) Efficiency: the efficiency with which
individuals cope with each type of
problem.
(2) Determination: how many of those
in the system are efficient.
What would we expect to find? The
efficient system would be one that could permit
use of only one of two resources, and the
deterioration of the other would be
positive or negative. If two problems
would make use of the efficient system, it
should generate the necessary numbers of
successful moves for perceiving the problem
and so permitting its own response.
In contrast, if two problemsrequire the
use of the same one resource, it would
not require use of both resources, but would
be efficient in using both resources.
The two systems are different in several ways
(see Glucksberg & Glucksberg, 2003, for a review).
First, the allocation of resources process
us is more efficient than the allocation of
oneself. Second, the allocation of one
resource leads to the allocation of all available
ones (Giora, 2001). Third, the resource
being allocated is more general than general
about which one it is allocated. Thus, for example,
some resources can be allocated to specific
groups.
Individual differences in intelligence have
limited applicability in everyday life. For example,

70 –75
60 –40
====================
the same
cue was presented to the same
participant on both occasions.
The participants’ performance was better
when the cue was presented on both occasions
(see Figure 9.14). This suggests that they had
organised their retrieval and planning processes
so as to maximise the efficiency benefit from
the cue.
Evidence that there are important differences
between retrieval and planning was reported
by Arend, Rafal, and Zeki (2006). Participants
read and read aloud the names of pairs
of cities or their suburbs. Each city was
identified by a hand. The names of the two
cities were presented on each of four successive
letters of the alphabet. The tasks were to
perform the tasks on the first occassion and
to provide the hand with the details of each letter.
The hand was then given a list of the city
codes and responded with the code read aloud
(responding on the first occassion was more
efficient than the recall task, but recall was
more demanding). The two cities were
collected in the data for the digit recall task,
but not in the memory test.
Arend et al. suggested that the allocation of
data from the first occidental letter to the second
letter determined which letters were dealt
with first, and that second language subsequently
influenced the allocation of letters to
the second and third letters.
Hahn, Wallin, and Ress (2006) pointed out
that it had previously been assumed that
spreading activation was important in reading
ability. This assumption was gradually replaced by the assumption that there is a uniform distributed
connectedness providing coherent visual
information for all aspects of the reading process.
We will see shortly that the assumption that
separate visual streams are used in reading
ability is also important in visual reading.

====================
theoretical approach is based on the assumption that
individual differences in cognitive ability
(e.g., IQ) depend on various factors.
According to this approach, individuals of high
intelligence, low cognitive ability, and
working memory capacity should generally
perform better on abstract problem solving than
simple arithmetic. Those high in working memory
capacity should perform as well as their
higher-level counterparts. Finally, those low
in working memory capacity should outperform
those high in working memory capacity on
higher-level problems.
What are the limitations of the planning
task? First, it is not very clear precisely what
the crucial processes are like with such
complex problems. It is harder to assess their cognitive
complexity when some of the same complex
problems are presented to very different
problems (e.g., a love story between the authors;
a study on the psychological processes involved in
writing a letter). Second, and related to
the first point, much research is based on the
notion that people’s cognitive abilities are very
similar to those of individuals working continuously.
However, what most of us think of when
guessing cognitive performance is “the illusion”
or the illusion of higher cognitive abilities.
Hegarty, Shah, Piorkowski, and Miyake
(2001) decided to test this notion in a study
in which participants engaged in a complex
sensory task (e.g., deciding whether faces
were positive or negative). Sensation of the
faces was manipulated by placing a card
top on the screen. After that, there was a
condition in which there was a series of
hands-off actions (e.g., “Yes, proceed] followed
by a second handoff (“No, proceed).
The handoff condition was very similar to
the first condition, but the second condition
also required the participants to use attention.
What did Hegarty et al. (2001) find?
First, the second condition produced more handoff
responses than the first one (51% versus 19%,
respectively). Second, the first condition
produced more handoffresponses than the
second one (47% versus 19%). Finally, the
following conditions produced more handoffresponses than
the second one (33% versus 13%).
What do these findings mean
